{"publicApplicationId":"net.palmdoc.framingham","description":"This application is a risk assessment tool which uses information from the Framingham Heart Study to predict a person\u2019s chance of having cardiovascular disease (CVD). It  uses the Framingham equation as described by Anderson (Am H J 1991), and the risk score is  mathematically derived and not determined by \"points\" though the result is similar to those derived by the latter means. The program also gives the option to check the \"hard\" CVD risk (MI and coronary death) by using the NCEP website's calculation engine - for the latter an Internet connection is required.\nUpdate: added color and UI fixes","version":"0.9.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/palmdoc.net","supportURL":"http:\/\/palmdoc.net\/?page_id=1013","custsupportemail":"palmdoc@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright Dr. Alan Teh 2010","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":53742,"installSize":1277952,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-11-29T16:35:38.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"net.palmdoc.framingham_0.9.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"5330\/en\/images\/1\/S\/framingham_2010-26-11_144329.png","screenshot":"5330\/en\/images\/1\/L\/framingham_2010-26-11_144329.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"5330\/en\/images\/2\/S\/framingham_2010-26-11_144331.png","screenshot":"5330\/en\/images\/2\/L\/framingham_2010-26-11_144331.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
