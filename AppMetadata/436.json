{"publicApplicationId":"llc.infews.oclock","description":"O'clock is the clock you have in your head, now in the palm of your hand. O'clock expresses the current time naturally in words, rather than digits. \n\nBe ready to answer the question, \"What time is it?\" with just the right note of insouciance and zen in-the-moment-ness. Screen rotation and Pixi fully supported.\n\nO'clock: for when the tyranny of numbers is too much.\n\nVersion 1.3: now has an improved \"hold\" mode. Tap the screen to turn of webOS's screen dimming. Hold mode, when your phone is in portrait mode, is now full screen. The lightbulb icon remains on when \"holding\".  Tap again to go back to normal use, where you can use the App menu for Help or Sharing.","version":"1.3.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.infe.ws","supportURL":"http:\/\/getsatisfaction.com\/infews\/products\/infews_o_clock","custsupportemail":"support@infe.ws","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Infews LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":78646,"installSize":5957720,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T01:59:18.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"llc.infews.oclock_1.3.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"436\/1.3.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/oclock_2009-19-11_213814.png","thumbnail":"436\/1.3.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/oclock_2009-19-11_213814.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"436\/1.3.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/oclock_2009-19-11_214140.png","thumbnail":"436\/1.3.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/oclock_2009-19-11_214140.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"436\/1.3.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/oclock_2010-07-05_141556.png","thumbnail":"436\/1.3.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/oclock_2010-07-05_141556.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
