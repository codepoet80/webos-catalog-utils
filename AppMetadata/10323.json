{"publicApplicationId":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks","description":"Hacks! is an Exhibition mode gallery of display hacks, ported from the Dominion of Awesome website at http:\/\/dominionofawesome.com\/hacks\/.\n\nThe tradition of display hacks goes back to early work on computers at universities like M.I.T. and Berkeley. The purpose was simple \u2014 to make a computer display pretty pictures. Eventually these turned into PC screen savers, and now webOS Exhibition provides a wonderful way to enjoy screen hacks while your Touchpad sits on its Touchstone.\n\nHacks! includes eight scenes:\n\n* Labyrinth - a maze of twisty passages grows before your eyes\n* Nimbus - cyber rain falling on water\n* HexaSpinner - six-sided figures occlude each other while rotating\n* Landscape - watch an angular world pass you by\n* Munch - munching squares, back in its classic phosphorescent glory\n* Orbit - chrome balls rotate endlessly\n* Pixelfade - your wallpaper fades in and out as though it were in a 16-bit video game\n* Spinner - animated text gyrating wildly\n\nNew scenes will be added over time as I port old Hacks and add new ones.\n\nNote: Charging time will increase due to the extra CPU used. The device may also get somewhat hot, but I've had no problems with overheating.","version":"1.2.0","versionNote":"Added Labyrinth scene.","homeURL":"http:\/\/dominionofawesome.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/dominionofawesome.com\/webOS\/Hacks\/","custsupportemail":"webos@dominionofawesome.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011-2012 The Dominion of Awesome","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":80930,"installSize":2457600,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-12-10T22:00:30.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":true,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_labyrinth.png","screenshot":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_labyrinth.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"thumbnail":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_hexaspinner.png","screenshot":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_hexaspinner.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/768x1024_320x480_tb_munch.png","screenshot":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_tb_munch.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"4":{"thumbnail":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/768x1024_320x480_tb_orbit.png","screenshot":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_tb_orbit.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"5":{"thumbnail":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/768x1024_320x480_tb_pixelfade.png","screenshot":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_tb_pixelfade.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
