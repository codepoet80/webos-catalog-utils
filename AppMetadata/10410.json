{"publicApplicationId":"com.mattpierce.enyo.rssbasicfree","description":"RSS Basic is a simple, straightforward RSS reader app designed for the HP TouchPad - with new support for basic Atom feeds. This is a free advertiser-supported version of the $0.99 RSS Basic app.  Its three-panel layout helps you to quickly see what feeds have new items and to navigate back and forth between them easily. News stories are kept in a local database for immediate access and offline viewing. WebOS Notifications let you see new stories come in and either dismiss or open them. Users can choose how often the app should check for feeds, and how many items it should store from each via the Preferences menu.","version":"1.1.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/mpierce.pie2k.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/mpierce.pie2k.com\/webosapplications\/rssbasic","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 Matt Pierce","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":80596,"installSize":589824,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-09-13T11:09:45.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h9fYhSRujYo","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/h9fYhSRujYo\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mattpierce.enyo.rssbasicfree_1.1.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10410\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_rssbasicfree_1.1.3_a.png","thumbnail":"10410\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_rssbasicfree_1.1.3_a.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10410\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_rssbasicfree_1.1.3_b.png","thumbnail":"10410\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_rssbasicfree_1.1.3_b.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"10410\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_rssbasicfree_1.1.3_c.png","thumbnail":"10410\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_rssbasicfree_1.1.3_c.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
