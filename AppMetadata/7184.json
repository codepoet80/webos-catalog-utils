This is the only example of his fiction in the public domain. These stories are all from Russian folklore, some comparatively well-known, others less so. Ransome spent some years in Russia as a newspaper correspondent fir the \u2018Daily News\u2019 and the \u2018Manchester Guardian\u2019 and was peripherally involved in the revolution. In the late twenties he married Evgenia Shvelpina, Trotsky\u2019s secretary, retired from newspapers and started writing his children\u2019s books.
