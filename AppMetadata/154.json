{"publicApplicationId":"com.avnerarbel.pushtopop","description":"Update: added pre3 and TouchPad support.\n\nThis game comes in many flavors in many different names. Some call it bubbles, others jawbreaker.  Nonetheless, no one can argue the fact that it is one of the most addicting games played. \n\nThe goal of the game is to pop the balls away. Push on a block of two or more balls of the same color, check the score and click again to pop them away. The larger the group is, the more points you get.  \n\nThe game has four modes: standard, continues, shifter & megashift modes. You can select the number of colors to pop from 3 easy colors to 6 colors. \n\nHigh scores are stored per game mode per number of colors.\n\nIf you have spare time, this game will take it away from you!\n\nnow, with a TouchPad friendly user interface.","version":"2.2.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/avnerarbel.wordpress.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/avnerarbel.wordpress.com\/","custsupportemail":"avnerarbel@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009- 2011 Avner Arbel","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":234684,"installSize":2490368,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T04:57:12.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.avnerarbel.pushtopop_2.2.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"154\/2.2.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_screen1.PNG","thumbnail":"154\/2.2.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_screen1.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"154\/2.2.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_screen2.PNG","thumbnail":"154\/2.2.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_screen2.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"154\/2.2.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_Pushtopop_welcome.png","thumbnail":"154\/2.2.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_Pushtopop_welcome.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
