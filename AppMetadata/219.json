{"publicApplicationId":"pictureplaza.eu.gomoku","description":"This game on the 10\u00d710 board is adapted from the paper \"Go-Moku and Threat-Space Search\" You play first and the computer will place a piece after you have placed your stone on the board. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game will show the winning line and block any further actions. Press the \"new game\" to restart the game. When the gameboard if completely filled the game ends in draw if there is no winning line shown. Advice, once the computer has an open row of three (one that is not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end) it has to be blocked immediately, or countered with a threat elsewhere on the board. If not blocked or countered, the open row of three will be extended to an open row of four, which threatens to win in two ways.
