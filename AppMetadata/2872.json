{"publicApplicationId":"com.rockus.racerexpansion","description":"*Online Leaderboard has been disabled* The new and improved version of Rockus Racer is here.  With two new courses, occasional cloud cover, and extra lives, this offers a great experience for fans of the original Rockus Racer, and new comers equally.  Why a new app and not just an update? Answer at end of description.  Race your car up the chalkboard racetrack in this simple arcade style racer.  The game gets harder as you play, and the longer you last the higher you score.  You get an online rank based on both your best High score and your cumulative score.  Keep playing to boost them both!  You do not need the original Rockus Racer in order to play this game.  If you have any concerns or comments, please email us at support@rockus-studios.com.  WHY A NEW APP? The answer is simple: online ranking.  With the many changes we made to the game (1ups, clouds, new maps, and under the covers code changes) the scores people will be getting now will differ from what they were getting.  Had we done an update to the original game, all the old high scores would have been meaningless, and we didn't want to do that to the thousands of players that earned their rank on the scoreboard.","version":"1.0.12","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.rockus-studios.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.rockus-studios.com","custsupportemail":"support@rockus-studios.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Rockus Studios, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":3141350,"installSize":7864320,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-08-21T08:23:38.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.rockus.racerexpansion_1.0.12_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"2872\/1.0.12\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_rr_exp_screenshot1b.png","thumbnail":"2872\/1.0.12\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_rr_exp_screenshot1b.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"2872\/1.0.12\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_rr_exp_screenshot2.png","thumbnail":"2872\/1.0.12\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_rr_exp_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"2872\/1.0.12\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_rr_exp_screenshot3.png","thumbnail":"2872\/1.0.12\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_rr_exp_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
