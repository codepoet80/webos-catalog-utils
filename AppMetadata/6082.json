{"publicApplicationId":"com.spatiality.nyclandmarkfinder090","description":"UPDATES WITH VERSION 1.2.2\n+ Added more photos from Wikipedia\n\nThe Landmarks: New York app is perfect for tourists, tour guides, architects, historic preservationists, urban planners, realtors, renters & homebuyers, and anyone else curious about NYC\u2019s architectural history. \n\nLandmarks: New York lists the official landmarked buildings and sites near you, anywhere in the 5 boros. It tells you when each landmark was designated (some as far back as 45 years! and as recent as December 2010), provides info from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, and provides links to Wikipedia. Thumbnail photos from Wikipedia are displayed for more than 600 landmarks, plus links to hi-res images.  You can view the location on a map, and email details about the landmark with just a single tap. \n\nWith more than 1,300 officially landmarked buildings, structures, or interiors throughout the city, almost every neighborhood in New York contains one -- but you\u2019d be surprised by the locations that are landmarked. \n\nSome NYC landmarks are obvious -- such as the Empire State Building. But the list includes other unexpected sites such as the street layout of lower Manhattan, the fence in Bowling Green, local libraries, wood frame houses, cemeteries, churches and synagogues, lampposts, and more. This app can help you explore the amazing architecture of New York! \n\nTry out our West Coast version!
