{"publicApplicationId":"com.appible.davidcopperfield","description":"\"'David Copperfield' or 'The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to publish on any account)' is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published as a novel in 1850. Many elements within the novel follow events in Dickens' own life, and it is probably the most autobiographical of all of his novels. In the preface to the 1867 Charles Dickens edition, he wrote, '\u2026 like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield.'\" - Wikipedia","version":"1.5.11","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"1351510","installSize":"1351510","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"0.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.davidcopperfield_1.5.11_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"2191\/de\/images\/1\/L\/davidcopp1.png","screenshot":"2191\/de\/images\/1\/L\/davidcopp1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2191\/de\/images\/2\/L\/davidcopp2.png","screenshot":"2191\/de\/images\/2\/L\/davidcopp2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2191\/de\/images\/3\/L\/davidcopp3.png","screenshot":"2191\/de\/images\/3\/L\/davidcopp3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
