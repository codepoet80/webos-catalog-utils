Google Maps can translate them into an address. The coordinates can also be copied, by clicking the \"Copy Coordinates\" button, so you can paste them elsewhere.\n\nThe GPS message center uses a few custom algorithms to help keep the user notified of what the GPS is doing.  This can be helpful to the user when the gps might take a while locating or locking onto satellites.  Use GPS message center when working with other GPS apps to stay informed.\n\n\nI, Casey Broome, or L337tech.com are not responsible for any damage this app could or may cause to your phone or anything your phone is or may effect.
