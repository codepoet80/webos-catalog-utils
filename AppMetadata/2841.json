Happy Holidays!**\nGPS Trip Panel is a robust GPS application used to keep the user informed of important trip data.  This app is especially useful for road travel. See this apps homepage for a list of features or watch the youtube video explaining each feature in detail.\nThe main purpose of this app is to keep the user up to date with the latest trip information.    Speed, heading, altitude, and various important trip information are made easily visible.  Even if you are in another application, GPS Trip Panel will display a dashboard popup.  You can also make this popup \"stick\"  so that you can manipulate maps and still be informed of the speed and heading.  You can adjust the GPS update interval and GPS speed cutoff to help smooth out and deliver more accurate GPS data.  With these features you can still expect good GPS data even in low satellite reception areas.\nThis app also delivers other great features such as displaying your coordinates.  Simply tap the coordinates to push them to Google Maps.  Google Maps can translate them into an address.  These coordinates can also be copied by clicking the \"Copy Coordinates\" button.  Once copied you can paste them anywhere.  Memos is a great place to paste the coordinates for records keeping.\nI, Casey Broome, or L337tech.com are not responsible for any damage this app could or may cause to your phone or anything your phone is or may affect.  This app should never be used as a sole navigation tool.  This app should never be used as the sole navigation tool for flight, boating, driving, moving by foot, or any other transportation method where exact location is important.  Mobile GPS's can be wildly inaccurate.  It is the sole responsibility of the user to use this app properly.  Use this app at your own risk.\n\nthanks,\n\nCasey Broome\nL337Tech.com","version":"1.1.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.l337tech.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.l337tech.com\/apps\/gps-trip-panel\/","custsupportemail":"comments@l337tech.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":263924,"installSize":1867776,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T11:55:58.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xnv3dHeDbGc","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/xnv3dHeDbGc\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.35,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.l337tech.gpstrippanel_1.1.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2841\/en\/images\/1\/S\/gpstrippanel_2010-23-11_163738.png","screenshot":"2841\/en\/images\/1\/L\/gpstrippanel_2010-23-11_163738.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"2841\/en\/images\/2\/S\/gpstrippanel_2010-23-11_163749.png","screenshot":"2841\/en\/images\/2\/L\/gpstrippanel_2010-23-11_163749.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"2841\/en\/images\/3\/S\/gpstrippanel_2010-30-04_171434.png","screenshot":"2841\/en\/images\/3\/L\/gpstrippanel_2010-30-04_171434.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"2841\/en\/images\/4\/S\/maps_2010-30-04_171629.png","screenshot":"2841\/en\/images\/4\/L\/maps_2010-30-04_171629.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"2841\/en\/images\/5\/S\/maps_2010-30-04_171615.png","screenshot":"2841\/en\/images\/5\/L\/maps_2010-30-04_171615.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
