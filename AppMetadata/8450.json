{"publicApplicationId":"com.georgemari.timeprojection","description":"Don't let other people set deadlines for your work.  Use your own work estimates to create a projection in time of your project completion dates.\n\nEnter your project details and Time Projection will calculate project end dates for you.  It will also show you the details of what you're working on each day going forward.\n\nWhat is Time Projection?\n\nTime Projection is a lean, easy-to-understand and useful alternative to desktop\nproject scheduling tools.  Instead of multiple resources, due dates, Gantt charts and what seem like endless options, Time Projection focuses on scheduling the most important resource - you.  It allows you to define multiple, overlapping projects.  You enter an estimate of the number of hours each task will \ntake, along with a start date you enter for each project.  Time Projection then calculates an end date for each project.  It also displays a list  with the details of the projected work that needs to get done on each day, which helps you to prove to your project manager(s) or clients why your work will take as long as you say it does. \n\nWho should use Time Projection?\n\nIf you are a project team member working on multiple projects at the same time, or a busy professional trying to juggle work for multiple clients simultaneously, then Time Projection can enable you to answer the question that everyone always asks you - \"When will you be done?\"","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.timeprojection.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.timeprojection.com\/support","custsupportemail":"support@timeprojection.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011, George Mari","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":109470,"installSize":2228224,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T21:51:11.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7t3jPQ9ch0w","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/7t3jPQ9ch0w\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":2,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.georgemari.timeprojection_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"8450\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/project_definition.png","thumbnail":"8450\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/project_definition.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"8450\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/calculate_spinners.png","thumbnail":"8450\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/calculate_spinners.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"8450\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/projects_with_dates.png","thumbnail":"8450\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/projects_with_dates.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"8450\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/task_definition.png","thumbnail":"8450\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/task_definition.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
