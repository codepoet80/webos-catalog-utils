{"publicApplicationId":"com.elegatech.quicktionary4letterwords","description":"Quicktionary: (n) a quick, convenient, off-line dictionary.\n\n\nQuicktionary4LetterWords:  Free, Fast, Word Book that will help find each word with only four ABCs.\n\nQuicktionary4LetterWords is a Free Version of Quicktionary by ElegeTech.com, LLC designed to allow you to experience the speed and convenience of Quicktionary.\n\nHow many four letter words are there in English?  We aren't entirely sure but there are over 3,200 in this dictionary.  The full version of Quicktionary by ElegaTech has over 140,000 words and looks-up words just as fast as the free edition.\n\nThis dictionary runs entirely offline and is super-quick.  One distinct difference between this and the full edition is that only four-letter words in the word definitions are 'click'able and will take you to the definition of that word.  In standard Quicktionary almost all the words in the definition can be touched to take you to that definition.  \n\nThanks for downloading and enjoy.","version":"2.0.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/elegatech.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/elegatech.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 ElegaTech.com, LLC.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":3108272,"installSize":10059776,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-02-07T07:16:49.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.elegatech.quicktionary4letterwords_2.0.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.elegatech.quicktionary4letterwords\/2.0.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_quick4preclipped1.png","thumbnail":"com.elegatech.quicktionary4letterwords\/2.0.3\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_quicktionary4letterwords_2012-05-02_202930.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.elegatech.quicktionary4letterwords\/2.0.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_quicktionary4letterwords_2012-05-02_202933.png","thumbnail":"com.elegatech.quicktionary4letterwords\/2.0.3\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_quicktionary4letterwords_2012-05-02_202933.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.elegatech.quicktionary4letterwords\/2.0.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_quick4precropped3.png","thumbnail":"com.elegatech.quicktionary4letterwords\/2.0.3\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_quicktionary4letterwords_2012-05-02_202940.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
