It's designed for players of all skill levels, with interesting new play styles to discover and grow in to. SMILES also doesn't pressure you in to making a move! Play at your own pace.\n\nSMILES DROP does away with slow gesture-based controls, and introduces the \"TOUCH SWAP\"; An easier, faster, and better way to play on a touch screen. Make matches to score points, and DON'T WAIT! Touch your next match RIGHT AWAY, and chain together HUGE combos and high scores! Break rocks and ice by DROPPING them, and either turn your device, or use the on screen buttons to SPIN the board.\n\nSMILES ZEN takes the \"TOUCH SWAP\" mechanic, and combines it with the best of patience games like Solitaire and Mahjong. The result is a game that's both thought provoking and engaging. Light up the board to win.\n\nSMILES HD features plenty of game modes, statistics, achievements, themes, and a full soundtrack!\n\nSMILES HD: The matching-game reinvented.","version":"1.5.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.sykhronics.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/support.sykhronics.com\/smiles\/webos","custsupportemail":"information@sykhronics.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2008-2012 Michael Kasprzak","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":35635996,"installSize":41156608,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T23:49:48.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SRSVAp6-tzA","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/SRSVAp6-tzA\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":4.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.sykhronics.smileshd_1.5.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"9455\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_tb_SmilesHD-00.png","screenshot":"9455\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_SmilesHD-00.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"9455\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_SmilesHD-01.png","screenshot":"9455\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_SmilesHD-01.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"9455\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_tb_SmilesHD-02.png","screenshot":"9455\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_SmilesHD-02.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"9455\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_SmilesHD-06.png","screenshot":"9455\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_SmilesHD-06.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
