{"publicApplicationId":"com.nacgeo.nacmaps","description":"NACMaps is a NAC enhancement for Google Maps to let users able to specify all areas and locations in the world with Natural Area Codes (NACs) (http:\/\/www.nacgeo.com\/nacsite\/) for satellite and street maps, local business\/attraction searches or turn-by-turn driving\/transit\/walking directions. A NAC is a unified, highly efficient, language independent, unique and universal representation for both areas and locations anywhere in the world. It can be used as an address, postcode, area code, property identifier and geographic coordinates. Using a NAC instead of a street address to specify a location for location based services can save 80% of key input, avoid difficulties in inputting foreign characters, eliminate errors from outdated or duplicated or missing addresses, and extend the location based services to all locations no matter whether there are street addresses or not. As the coordinates of the Universal Map Grids, a NAC can also be directly pinpointed on all kinds of maps with the Universal Map Grids. As a Global Postal Code, it can make all mail sorted from the world level to final mail boxes automatically. Since an eight or ten character NAC can specify a location to the resolution of 30 meters and 1 meter respectively, it is also called a Universal Address. NACMaps can also function as a spatial watch to display your local Universal Address with the device internal GPS.
