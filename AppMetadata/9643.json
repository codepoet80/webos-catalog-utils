Nevertheless, on a cold wet spring Saturday they find themselves in an antique store, inexplicably drawn to a small, tattered old fashioned doll. Even the owner of the store seems to understand that the doll somehow belongs to the girls. Once the twins buy the doll, stranger and stranger things begin to happen, and a young girl from the past seems to be calling out to them. The search to discover the history of the little doll brings the twins terrifyingly close to the world of the supernatural as they finally solve a tantalizing mystery. Janet Lunn's first novel, long unavailable, is republished in a fresh, beautiful edition.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"4989894","installSize":"4989894","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"6.3","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.doublespell-9781770490406-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9643\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9643\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9643\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9643\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9643\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9643\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
