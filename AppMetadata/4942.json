{"publicApplicationId":"nodomain.goetz.michael.hourglass","description":"Get your own hour glass to your palm. It is much more stylish when used to determinate the passed time than a \"simple\" stopwatch. \nThe main feature is to have a timer for tea, therefore black, white, green and red sand are simulated. For each sand colour the amount of sand in the hour glass is so set that the time it takes matches the time it takes to make a tea of that kind. Also the app starts very fast.\nTo swap the sand colour move left or right with your finger over the screen. To change the design of the hour glass move up or down over the screen.\nTo start, stop or change flow direction tap on the screen.","version":"1.2.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/klicker.wikidot.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/klicker.wikidot.com\/about-hourglass","custsupportemail":"michel.goetz@web.de","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2010 Michael Goetz","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":161240,"installSize":1966080,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-09-22T17:18:58.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"nodomain.goetz.michael.hourglass_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"4942\/en\/images\/1\/S\/shot1.png","screenshot":"4942\/en\/images\/1\/L\/shot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"4942\/en\/images\/2\/S\/shot2.png","screenshot":"4942\/en\/images\/2\/L\/shot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"4942\/en\/images\/3\/S\/shot3.png","screenshot":"4942\/en\/images\/3\/L\/shot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"4942\/en\/images\/4\/S\/shot4.png","screenshot":"4942\/en\/images\/4\/L\/shot4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
