{"publicApplicationId":"com.bitsofgodsoftware.podfrenzy","description":"** webOS 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Compatible ** podFrenzy is a new incarnation of the famous webOS application named drPodder, originally developed by Jamie Hatfield. The initial release is still designed for the smartphone but has been enhanced to work full screen (portrait or landscape) on the TouchPad. In the coming weeks\/months, a new update to this app will be released that will be optimized for the TouchPad, so depending on if you are toting around your smartphone or tablet, you will have the best podcatcher on webOS and it will be optimized for simplicity and screen size!\n\nDownload it now for only $0.99, because the price will go up once it is updated for the TouchPad!! Enjoy!\n\npodFrenzy allows you to stream or download audio and video podcasts directly to your webOS device without the need to hook up to a computer! Some Radio programs even have Podcast feeds you can add. Includes sample podcasts, but you can add new podcasts by URL or search a directory. Podcasts can be updated on demand or through scheduled updates. Playback streaming or downloaded podcasts. Optional background downloading of new podcasts. Automatic bookmarking for audio podcasts so you can finish later. Playlist support to group your podcasts together & play through them all at once. \n\nI personally want to thank Jamie Hatfield for all of the work he did over the past couple years with drPodder to make it what it is today and to leave the code open for all of us to learn from. \n\nIt is with his approval that we are keeping the legacy of drPodder alive and bringing it to the new webOS devices and screen resolutions.","version":"1.0.6","homeURL":"http:\/\/bitsofgodsoftware.com\/podFrenzy","supportURL":"http:\/\/bitsofgodsoftware.com\/podFrenzy","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright
