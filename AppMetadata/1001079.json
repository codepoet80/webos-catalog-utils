{"publicApplicationId":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd","description":"The Ur Quan Masters is a webOS port of legendary Star Control II game. This is the pre-pre release, especially in virtual controls.\n\nWarning! First start can be long (up to 30 seconds), be patient.\n\nStar Control II: The Ur-Quan Masters, developed by Toys for Bob and published by Accolade in 1992, is one of the most acclaimed games of all time. Better known than it's predecessor and better loved than it's reviled sequel, Star Control II can be found on many a \u2018best of' list. \n\n'Star Control II' is one of those rare games which crosses many gaming genres (adventure, strategy, and even some minor micro-management) and somehow comes together perfectly. With excellent production values, witty writing, an epic storyline, and memorable characters galore, this truly is one of the finest gaming titles in existence. If you are in any way a fan of great gaming and don't mind using your brain a little, you owe it to yourself to get your hands on 'Star Control II' as quickly as you can.\nThe game takes place after the end of the first 'Star Control' adventure, as you might suspect. Unfortunately, Earth and its pals in the Alliance of Free Stars got their intergalactic butts handed to them by the heinous Ur-Quan and their fiendish Hierarchy, and the benevolent races of the Alliance have either been forced to join the Hierachy or have been enslaved on their home planet under a red forcefield. Things are looking pretty grim.\nYou (the gamer) play a young captain who was on a far-off mission when the human race was being enslaved, and you return to your beloved blue planet to find it encased under a pulsating red slave shield. I don't want to spend an hour explaining the story, but needless to say, you eventually try to reform the Alliance, save the Earth, stick it to the Ur-Quan, and do a few other dozen things that pop up along the way. The complexity of the story will surprise a lot of gamers who are used to the empty carnage of action titles and standard space combat games.","version":"7.3778.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/forums.webosnation.com\/webos-homebrew-apps\/319866-star-control-2-ur-quan-masters.html","supportURL":"http:\/\/forums.webosnation.com\/webos-homebrew-apps\/319866-star-control-2-ur-quan-masters.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"(C)2012 Shadson\/UQM Development team","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":35539362,"installSize":385351680,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-12-14T21:41:19.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KOndm_1w1ws","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/KOndm_1w1ws\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd_7.3778.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd\/7.3778.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_untitled01.png","thumbnail":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd\/7.3778.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_untitled01.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd\/7.3778.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_untitled02.png","thumbnail":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd\/7.3778.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_untitled02.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd\/7.3778.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_untitled03.png","thumbnail":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd\/7.3778.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_untitled03.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd\/7.3778.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_untitled04.png","thumbnail":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd\/7.3778.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_untitled04.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd\/7.3778.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_untitled05.png","thumbnail":"net.sourceforge.uqmsd\/7.3778.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_untitled05.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
