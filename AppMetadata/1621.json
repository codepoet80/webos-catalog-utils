{"publicApplicationId":"com.rockus.animals","description":"* Rockus Animals is a fun way to entertain young children while educating them about the sounds of animals. There are two modes to choose from. Browse mode is a standard flash card system, displaying a full screen image of an animal while its sound is played. To hear the sound again, simply tap the image, or swipe left or right to change animals. Challenge mode involves selecting which animal was heard from four displayed images. Both modes have many optional settings such as: Auto-advancing Browse mode to entertain the really young toddlers and babies; Tap advancing to next animal; Only playing the sound with a tap (so the child has time to guess the sound before tapping to hear it); or hide an animal catagory (like \"wild\"), to name a few. We plan to continue to add options and animals to the app, as well as make any improvements we can. If you have any ideas for improvements, or other comments and concerns, please send them to support@rockus-studios.com.
