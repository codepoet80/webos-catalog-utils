{"publicApplicationId":"de.knoopnet.thinfileview","description":"This app is the free version of 'ThinFileEditor' and has nearly the same features but you can only edit the first 2048 bytes of a file:\n1. Browsing the contents of your 'media\/internal' directory and opening the files webOs can handle.\n2. Creating folders and editing the text files (or the extractable text of others) and saving them locally.\n3. Working with locally stored .html files: You may create and edit them, check their layout preview and display them in the webOS browser to test links or javascript code.\n\nNavigating through the directories is provided via buttons to prevent inputs by mistake. The order of the names within a directory is determined by the 'inodes' webOS works with.\n\nIf a file is 'viewed' in 'hex'-mode the left column will show all characters that are printable in webOS or a red 'I'.\n'tab', 'line feet', 'carriage return' and '(hard)spaces' are also masked to avoid layout issues. Blue characters indicate a 'non-ascii-standard'.\nThe center contains the 'hexadecimal' code: red characters show that there is a 'double-value' byte which is displayed after each line and yellow 'hh' represent byte code 65533 (hxFFFD). Enjoy!\n\nAny feedback how to improve this app would be appreciated before reviewing this app as 'not-so-good'. Just send an email to webmaster(at)knoopnet.de, thanks.","version":"1.1.8","versionNote":"Creating folders, editing .text & .html files and previewing .html files added.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.knoopnet.de\/apps","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.knoopnet.de\/apps\/tifi.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 knoopnet.de","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":24884,"installSize":360448,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-10-11T17:48:08.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"de.knoopnet.thinfileview_1.1.8_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9506\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_thinf1.png","thumbnail":"9506\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_thinf1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"9506\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_thinf2.png","thumbnail":"9506\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_thinf2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"9506\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_thinf3.png","thumbnail":"9506\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_thinf3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"9506\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_thinf4.png","thumbnail":"9506\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_thinf4.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"9506\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_thinf5.png","thumbnail":"9506\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_thinf5.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
