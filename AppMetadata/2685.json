Thanks goes to Jessie and Ron for the suggestions! **\n\nBuenos d\u00edas!\n\nThis is the iCaramba Spanish Audio Dictionary.

It is thus an excellent travel-companion.\n\nFEATURES:\n- ALL words have audio!\n- Alphabetically sorted by English and Spanish.\n- Very user-friendly navigation.\n\nFor more Spanish apps, visit: www.iLoveLingo.com\n\nBienvenido!\n*LIMITATIONS LITE-VERSION: - Only sorts Spanish words alphabetically.*","version":"3.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.ilovelingo.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.ilovelingo.com\/spanish_palm.aspx","custsupportemail":"info@ilovelingo.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Avataris Media","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":9232784,"installSize":23298048,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-02-22T08:59:54.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.avatarismedia.palmspanishdictionarylite_3.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2685\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ScreenA.PNG","screenshot":"2685\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ScreenA.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"2685\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ScreenB.PNG","screenshot":"2685\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ScreenB.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
