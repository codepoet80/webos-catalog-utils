{"publicApplicationId":"com.cksoft.evadotslite","description":"See http:\/\/wp.me\/pXWG8-1r for changes in the latest release!\n\nEvaDots is a delightfully fun & addicting game for the WebOs platform. It is compatible with both the Pre and Pixi devices. \n\nThe goal is simple: try to get as many moving dots on the playfield as possible without having any of the dots collide. If any dots collide, the game is over. The dots move at the same rate, so as long as a collision is avoided once, those dots should never collide. One hundred points are awarded for each dot on the screen. \n\nFeatures: \n* Customizable gameplay \u2013 control the speed and color of the dots, the playfield background, and other gameplay elements.\n* Global online highscore table \u2013 At the end of each game, a score can be submitted to an online leaderboard. See how well your score compares with players around the world! \n\nNOTE: This free version is ad supported and is limited to one post to the leaderboards in a 24 hour period. Upgrade to EvaDots Full to remove this restriction! Thanks a lot for downloading, and have fun!","version":"1.0.6","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/cksoft.wordpress.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/cksoft.wordpress.com\/","custsupportemail":"chris.koenig@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Chris Koenig","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":380612,"installSize":2162688,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-12-18T01:27:08.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f1djddb91pY","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/f1djddb91pY\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.cksoft.evadotslite_1.0.6_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"3967\/en\/images\/1\/S\/evadotsfull_2010-17-07_101641.png","screenshot":"3967\/en\/images\/1\/L\/evadotsfull_2010-17-07_101641.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"3967\/en\/images\/2\/S\/evadotsfull_2010-17-07_101630.png","screenshot":"3967\/en\/images\/2\/L\/evadotsfull_2010-17-07_101630.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
