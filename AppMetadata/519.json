{"publicApplicationId":"com.finelytunedmachines.webos.countdown","description":"Like the timer on your microwave, conveniently in your pocket, and now with many more options. Run as a card, as a dashboard app, or completely in the background. Set times up to 99:99:99, or over one hundred hours. Choose either a momentary, notification-style alarm, or a persistent, ringtone-style one. There is also an option to play the alarm sound even when the ringer switch is off. Other options include enabling the dashboard controls while the screen is locked, and keeping the screen from going to sleep while the timer is in the foreground.","version":"1.3.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/finelytunedmachines.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/finelytunedmachines.com","custsupportemail":"nathan.roling@finelytunedmachines.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Finely Tuned Machines","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":58040,"installSize":1507328,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T05:52:16.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.finelytunedmachines.webos.countdown_1.3.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":[]}
