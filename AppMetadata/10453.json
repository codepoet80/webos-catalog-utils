{"publicApplicationId":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate","description":"Hacks! is an Exhibition mode gallery of display hacks, ported from the Dominion of Awesome website at http:\/\/dominionofawesome.com\/hacks\/. Hacks! Zero is the free version, containing all but the newest two display hacks from the full version.\n\nThe tradition of display hacks goes back to early work on computers at universities like M.I.T. and Berkeley. The purpose was simple \u2014 to make a computer display pretty pictures. Eventually these turned into PC screen savers, and now webOS Exhibition provides a wonderful way to enjoy screen hacks while your Touchpad sits on its Touchstone.\n\nHacks! Zero includes six scenes:\n\n* HexaSpinner - six-sided figures occlude each other while rotating\n* Landscape - watch an angular world pass you by\n* Munch - munching squares, back in its classic phosphorescent glory\n* Orbit - chrome balls rotate endlessly\n* Pixelfade - your wallpaper fades in and out as though it were in a 16-bit video game\n* Spinner - animated text gyrating wildly\n\nThe full version of Hacks! (also available in the App Catalog) contains two more scenes - Nimbus and HexaSpinner.\n\nNote: Charging time will increase due to the extra CPU used. The device may also get somewhat hot, but I've had no problems with overheating.","version":"1.2.0","versionNote":"Added HexaSpinner scene.","homeURL":"http:\/\/dominionofawesome.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/dominionofawesome.com\/webOS\/Hacks\/","custsupportemail":"webos@dominionofawesome.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011-2012 The Dominion of Awesome","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":80950,"installSize":2457600,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-12-11T20:29:11.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":true,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_hexaspinner.png","screenshot":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_hexaspinner.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"thumbnail":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_landscape.png","screenshot":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_landscape.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_munch.png","screenshot":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_munch.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"4":{"thumbnail":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_orbit.png","screenshot":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_orbit.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"5":{"thumbnail":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_pixelfade.png","screenshot":"com.dominionofawesome.hacks-cheapskate\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_pixelfade.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
