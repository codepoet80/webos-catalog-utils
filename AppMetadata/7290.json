Monsieur Colbert, first minister, who is jealous of Fouquet and plots his downfall.\n \n\nAramis discovers the hidden Philippe and hatches a plot to substitute him for the sitting king, putting Louis in Philippe\u2019s cell in the Bastille. This even succeeds\u2026 for a short while. But Aramis has not reckoned with a man whose loyalty to the throne exceeds his own welfare and who disastrously reverses the plot. Now it is time for the plotters to scurry to cover, there to figure some way to recover their lost ambitions.
