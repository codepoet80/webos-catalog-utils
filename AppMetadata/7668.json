{"publicApplicationId":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines","description":"Compiled after over 5+ years of full time road-tripping across the USA, and after many hours of research on state specific information, State Lines is an indispensable traveler\u2019s guidebook to highly variable state laws and regulations.\n\nBecause some things change when you cross the line...\n\nCurrently State Lines tracks 46 pieces of travel relevant information for each of the 50 states; including vehicle gun carry laws, state sales tax, average local tax rates, time zones, towing & RV specific laws, gas\/diesel taxes, rest area overnight parking rules, default speed limits, alcohol sales laws, smoking bans, open container laws, state park camping entrance fees, pet leash laws, bicycle and motorcycle helmet laws, cell phone & texting bans, left hand turn rules, and more.\n\nState Lines is location aware, so it can automatically show you information about nearby states. The entire State Lines database is integrated into the application, so State Lines works even when you are out of cellular or WiFi coverage.\n\nWhen you visit a new state, have you ever wondered: \n\nCan I txt and drive? \nIs the sales tax lower 50 miles down the road? \nWill the gas tax be cheaper here? \nCan I buy real beer in the grocery stores? \nCan I overnight in rest areas? \nIs smoking allowed in restaurants? \nAre radar detectors legal? \nCan I make a left turn on red? \nAre helmets required?\n\n****** \n\nNOTE; State Lines is intended to provide an at-a-glance summarized guide to rules and regulations, and it is not an exhaustive legal reference. While every effort has been made to provide quality data, no warranty for accuracy of data is expressed or implied.  Keep in mind, local regulations can often override state level rules, and laws frequently change. Always verify with the proper authorities before assuming anything.\n\nThe last major update to the State Lines database: \n  November 2011","version":"1.1.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.technomadia.com\/apps","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.technomadia.com\/apps","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Two Steps Beyond LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.technomadia.com\/apps","locale":null,"appSize":"1423362","installSize":"1423362","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"3.04","currency":"USD","filename":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_mainscreen.png","screenshot":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_mainscreen.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174212.png","screenshot":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174212.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174212.png","screenshot":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174212.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_ut_list.png","screenshot":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_ut_list.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174232.png","screenshot":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174232.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174232.png","screenshot":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174232.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_ga_overview.png","screenshot":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_ga_overview.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174251.png","screenshot":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174251.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174251.png","screenshot":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_tb_statelines_2011-09-08_174251.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_ca_speedlimits.png","screenshot":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_ca_speedlimits.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_nc_alcohol.png","screenshot":"com.twostepsbeyond.statelines\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_nc_alcohol.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
