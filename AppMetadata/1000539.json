{"publicApplicationId":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku","description":"Tridoku is remarkably similar to Sudoku, yet clearly different at the same time. The same logic that is used to solve Sudoku puzzles can be applied to Tridoku, but the different rules make Tridoku a new and refreshing challenge. \n\nLike Sudoku, it is simple to understand and to play, but challenging in the logic that the puzzles require. The rules of Sudoku state that:   The numbers 1 \u2013 9 must be placed in each of the nine large boxes.   The numbers 1 \u2013 9 must be placed in each row.   The numbers 1 \u2013 9 must be placed in each column. \n\nThe rules of Tridoku are similar:   The numbers 1 \u2013 9 must be placed in each of the nine large triangles.   The numbers 1 \u2013 9 must be placed in the three legs of the inner shaded triangle.   The numbers 1 \u2013 9 must be placed in the three legs of the outer shaded triangle. Adding to the uniqueness of Tridoku is a fourth rule:   No two neighboring (touching) cells may contain the same number. \n\nTridoku is a challenging, yet therapeutic puzzle that can be enjoyed by all. It may seem difficult to pick up & learn a new puzzle, but stick with it \u2013 I know you\u2019ll be hooked by the time you finish your second puzzle.","version":"0.3.18","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.gosyntactix.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.gosyntactix.com\/products","custsupportemail":"tridoku@gosyntactix.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 Syntactix, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1616936,"installSize":5472256,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T08:47:02.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku_0.3.18_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku\/0.3.18\/en\/images\/1\/S\/768x1024_320x480_tb_tridoku_2012-04-02_210239.png","screenshot":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku\/0.3.18\/en\/images\/1\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_tb_tridoku_2012-04-02_210239.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"thumbnail":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku\/0.3.18\/en\/images\/2\/S\/768x1024_320x480_tb_tridoku_2012-04-02_210250.png","screenshot":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku\/0.3.18\/en\/images\/2\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_tb_tridoku_2012-04-02_210250.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku\/0.3.18\/en\/images\/3\/S\/768x1024_320x480_tb_tridoku_2012-04-02_210305.png","screenshot":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku\/0.3.18\/en\/images\/3\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_tb_tridoku_2012-04-02_210305.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"4":{"thumbnail":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku\/0.3.18\/en\/images\/4\/S\/768x1024_320x480_tb_tridoku_2012-04-02_210319.png","screenshot":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku\/0.3.18\/en\/images\/4\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_tb_tridoku_2012-04-02_210319.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"5":{"thumbnail":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku\/0.3.18\/en\/images\/5\/S\/768x1024_320x480_tb_tridoku_2012-04-02_210343.png","screenshot":"com.gosyntactix.paid.tridoku\/0.3.18\/en\/images\/5\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_tb_tridoku_2012-04-02_210343.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
