{"publicApplicationId":"com.mikagika.rolladoodle","description":"Remember the toy you had when you were a kid that let you sketch out crude drawings by turning the two knobs?  We designed roll-a-doodle with that experience in mind, but updated it for your webOS device.  Tilt your phone to roll a ball around the screen, drawing as it goes.  You can change the width, opacity, and color of the line.  As an added bonus\u2014you can even draw with a completely transparent line, which certainly takes care of that problem of how to get from one side of the drawing to the other!  Your doodles are saved, so you can continue working on your masterpiece later.   To erase, simply shake your device or turn it over.       This version of roll-a-doodle is ad-supported.  Upgrade to roll-a-doodle plus (not available in all areas) to get rid of the ads, save more doodles, and change the background color.      Feedback via the reviews or email is always appreciated!","version":"1.1.00","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/rolladoodle\/index.html","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/rolladoodle\/index.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2009 mikagika, ltd.","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/rolladoodle\/index.html","locale":null,"appSize":"40196","installSize":"40196","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":0,"currency":"USD","filename":"com.mikagika.rolladoodle_1.1.00_all.ipk","free":true,"images":[{"thumbnail":"1002\/de\/images\/1\/L\/rolladoodle_2009-24-12_125819.png","screenshot":"1002\/de\/images\/1\/L\/rolladoodle_2009-24-12_125819.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1002\/de\/images\/2\/L\/rolladoodle_2009-24-12_125826.png","screenshot":"1002\/de\/images\/2\/L\/rolladoodle_2009-24-12_125826.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1002\/de\/images\/3\/L\/rolladoodle_2009-23-12_155553.png","screenshot":"1002\/de\/images\/3\/L\/rolladoodle_2009-23-12_155553.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1002\/de\/images\/4\/L\/rolladoodle_2009-23-12_181244.png","screenshot":"1002\/de\/images\/4\/L\/rolladoodle_2009-23-12_181244.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
