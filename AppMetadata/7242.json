These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nCandide is a relentless, brutal assault on government, society, religion, education, and, above all, optimism. Dr. Pangloss teaches his young students Candide and Cunegonde that everything in this world is for the best, a sentiment they cling to as the world steps in to teach them otherwise. The novel is brilliant, hilarious, blasphemous. . . and Voltaire never admitted to writing it. (Summary by Ted Delorme)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"277786","installSize":"277786","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.2","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.candideaudio_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7242\/images\/1\/L\/candide1.png","screenshot":"7242\/images\/1\/L\/candide1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7242\/images\/2\/L\/candide2.png","screenshot":"7242\/images\/2\/L\/candide2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
