{"publicApplicationId":"com.mavigames.rat-man","description":"Price update: Spring is making Pacrat feel giddy, now offered at a lower price!\n **update 1.1** Thanks to your great feedback, now with saves between levels, more help, keyboard controls, and more.  For those of you who want more speed, try the later levels in the paid version,  in development is a dificulty setting that doubles the speed for those who want more of an arcade experience rather than a casual one.  A greedy merchant who hates rats (gasp!) has locked up all the cheese.  Roger's rather large family is starving.  Since Roger collects treasure the same way you or I might gather pocket lint, he knows he's the rat for the job!  He makes his way to the merchant's warehouse and slips inside ..  and there lies more cheese than any Rat has ever seen!  Piece of cake, thinks Roger.  Until the door snicks closed behind him, and the merchant's evil laugh chases him inside ..\n\n20 levels of cheese gobbling goodness in the tradition of an arcade classic!  Avoid the cats and survive as long as you can.  Cats react to Roger's position so patterns can be developed to solve each level that maximize your score.  Except for those random traps, that is ...\n\nIntuitive touch controls and key commands bring the maze game to the PALM phone without the  need for a joystick.  Enjoy!","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/mavigames.yolasite.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/mavigames.yolasite.com","custsupportemail":"browne_roger@hotmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 Roger Browne","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":11730776,"installSize":17563648,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T19:37:55.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mavigames.rat-man_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"7958\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screen1.png","thumbnail":"7958\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screen1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"7958\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screen2.png","thumbnail":"7958\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screen2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"7958\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screen3.png","thumbnail":"7958\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screen3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"7958\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screen5.png","thumbnail":"7958\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screen5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"7958\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/screen4.png","thumbnail":"7958\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/screen4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
