{"publicApplicationId":"com.lochagosgames.soccermanager","description":"Soccer Manager is an app aimed at helping little league soccer coaches manage the playtime of their kids.  It features the ability to track each player, the number of times he has played, and the amount of gametime she has received.  In addition Soccer Manager also provides timer, period indicator, and score tracking capabilities.  You can also configure the roster size, number of periods, and period length.  Your roster is preserved between games.\n\n\nIt doesn't take much of a stretch to use this as a bench\/playtime monitor for any timed sport kids play such as basketball or hockey.\n\n\nI admire my daughter's soccer coaches thus far.  They run across the field play\nreferee, coach, cheerleader, and sometimes even parent.  The younger the kids the more like herding cats it can be.  I do not know how they manage to keep anything straight inside of their heads.  This little app is dedicated to them, and all of the other soccer coaches out there.  I don't know how you do it but I hope this can help.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"Version 1.0.1:\nAdded roster sizes for 8, 9, and 10 player teams.  It now supposed 3-11 players.\nFixed an annoying bug with the timer\/period indicator integration.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.lochagos.com\/games\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.lochagos.com\/games\/","custsupportemail":"tony@lochagos.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 Lochagos Games","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":349160,"installSize":1998848,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T04:00:53.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.lochagosgames.soccermanager_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10534\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_soccermanager_2011-14-09_211905.png","thumbnail":"10534\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_soccermanager_2011-14-09_211905.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"10534\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_soccermanager_2011-14-09_211921.png","thumbnail":"10534\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_soccermanager_2011-14-09_211921.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"10534\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_soccermanager_2011-14-09_212026.png","thumbnail":"10534\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_soccermanager_2011-14-09_212026.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"10534\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_soccermanager_2011-14-09_212418.png","thumbnail":"10534\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_soccermanager_2011-14-09_212418.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
