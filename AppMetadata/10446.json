{"publicApplicationId":"com.pastorrich1.tapforhelphd","description":"Tap for HELP! HD is a simple application designed to help you find common sources of non-emergency help and information in a single tap.\n\nIn order to get the best results from this application you should ensure that Google Location Services is turned on. If location services do not return an accurate location, you can also enter a Zip Code or City, ST.\n\nThis application and its related search terms are all in English so results in non-English speaking countries may vary.\n\nThis updated version is a complete rebuild from the ground up in Enyo. I have added speech just for fun. If you would like to suggest other search categories or ideas just shoot me an email using the app menu and email link for support in the \"About\" section.  \n\nIn the next update I will remove the ones you tell me are least useful and add new ones based on your requests.","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"This version is completely new, built in Enyo and adds speech for your search item plus zip or city, ST if entered. The zip and city, ST are also new features to the app","homeURL":"http:\/\/dsquareddev.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/dsquareddev.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":3769804,"installSize":5603328,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-10-18T09:34:03.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.pastorrich1.tapforhelphd_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10446\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_enyotap_2011-10-10_164646.png","thumbnail":"10446\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_enyotap_2011-10-10_164646.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10446\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_enyotap_2011-10-10_164700.png","thumbnail":"10446\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_enyotap_2011-10-10_164700.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"10446\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_enyotap_2011-10-10_164709.png","screenshot":"10446\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_enyotap_2011-10-10_164709.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"10446\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_maps_2011-10-10_164936.png","thumbnail":"10446\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_maps_2011-10-10_164936.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"10446\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_maps_2011-10-10_164901.png","thumbnail":"10446\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_maps_2011-10-10_164901.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
