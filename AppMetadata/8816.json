{"publicApplicationId":"com.appible.thewindinthewillowsaudio","description":"In this app you can download & store chapters for listening without an internet connection, perhaps on your next flight or road trip. These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nThis much-loved story follows a group of animal friends in the English countryside as they pursue adventure \u2026 and as adventure pursues them! The chief characters \u2013 Mole, Rat, and Toad \u2013 generally lead upbeat and happy lives, but their tales are leavened with moments of terror, homesickness, awe, madcap antics, and derring-do.\nAlthough classed as children\u2019s literature, The Wind in the Willows holds a gentle fascination for adults too. The vocabulary is decidedly not \u201cDick and Jane\u201d, and a reader with a love of words will find new ones to treasure, even if well-equipped for the journey. Parents will appreciate the themes of loyalty, manners, self-restraint, and comradeship which are evident throughout the book. When the characters err, they are prompt to acknowlege it, and so a reading of this book can model good behavior to children, who will otherwise be enchanted with the many ways in which the lives of these bucolic characters differ from modern life.\nThis book was so successful that it enabled the author to retire from banking and take up a country life somewhat like that of his creations. It has been adapted for screen, stage, and even a ride at the original Disneyland.\n(Summary by Mark F. Smith)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
