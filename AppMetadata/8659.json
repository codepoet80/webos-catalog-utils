T. S. Eliot called it \u2018the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels\u2019. It contains a number of ideas which became common tropes of the genre: a large number of suspects, red herrings, a crime being investigated by talented amateurs who happen to be present when it is committed, and two police officers who exemplify respectively the \u2018local bungler\u2019 and the skilled, professional, Scotland Yard detective.\n    (Summary from Wikipedia) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
