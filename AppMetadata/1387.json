{"publicApplicationId":"com.orstudios.fftipcalc","description":"The Full Featured Tip Calculator is a calculator to help you calculate how much to tip while at a restaurant or bar. \n\n***Includes the ability to sum the price of each item bought without having to do the math in your head or with a separate calculator.\n\n***Can split items amongst multiple diners.\n\n***Has support for liquor tax.\n\nSplit Evenly:\n\nIn this mode just enter the total dollar amount of the bill, the dollar amount of tax, the tip percent and how many times to split it. For bill and taxes you can enter multiple amounts separated with a + sign which will get added together for a total. So if a meal was bought for 11.50, a drink for 2.50 and an appetizer for 4.95, enter 11.50+2.50+4.95. This saves you from having to do the addition in your head or with a separate calculator.\n\nSplit Exactly:\n\nThis mode can be used to split the bill up exactly according to the price of each person's meal. The total amount of tax which is taxed on all items should be entered into the first text field at the top. The second tax text field is used to enter the liquor tax which is only taxed on liquor. If your jurisdiction does not have a liquor tax then just leave this blank. The tax for each diner is calculated on a proportional basis of the total bill.\n\nTo add a diner just click the Add Diner button at the bottom of the screen. This will pop up a dialog for you input the information for the diner.  When you are done, press the save button and the dinner will be added to the diner list.  Each user can then enter the price of the items they bought. \n\nTo add an item that was shared amongst multiple diners click the Add Shared button. Another pop up dialog will open for you to enter the amount of the item or items, the diners who shared it using their number separated by a comma, and whether or not it was liquor.\n\nWhen all the information is filled out, click the calculate button at the bottom of the page. This will do the calculations and display them on the results page.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/orstudios.blogspot.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/orstudios.blogspot.com\/","custsupportemail":"orstudios@gmx.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 or Studios","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":93668,"installSize":2127780,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-05-31T23:54:01.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.orstudios.fftipcalc_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"1387\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/fftipcalc_2010-25-01_235645.png","thumbnail":"1387\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/fftipcalc_2010-25-01_235645.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"1387\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/fftipcalc_2010-25-01_235820.png","thumbnail":"1387\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/fftipcalc_2010-25-01_235820.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"1387\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/fftipcalc_2010-25-01_235826.png","thumbnail":"1387\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/fftipcalc_2010-25-01_235826.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"1387\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/fftipcalc_2010-25-01_235839.png","thumbnail":"1387\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/fftipcalc_2010-25-01_235839.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"1387\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/fftipcalc_2010-25-01_235909.png","thumbnail":"1387\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/fftipcalc_2010-25-01_235909.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
