{"publicApplicationId":"net.rcgtech.baseconverter","description":"English only: Baseconverter is a tool used to convert between binary, decimal, hexadecimal and octal. It will break up the input value (up to a 32-bit positive number) into the upper and lower word values (16-bit). It then further breaks up the word into the upper and lower bytes (8-bit). It displays this in both decimal and binary. This is very handy when you are programming or debugging. \nOf course this can also be used just for fun!
