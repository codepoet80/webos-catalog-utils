{"publicApplicationId":"com.daveprochnow.lifelist","description":"What is a Life List?\n\nA Life List is a collection of sightings, occurrences, or discoveries that color the fabric of events that help to shape our lives. It's kinda like a brag book on steroids.\n\nIn order to facilitate your lifelong endeavor of meticulous note-taking, the LifeList was developed. Equipped with data entry fields wrapped up inside a potent database, a LifeList is able to fully answer all of the \u201cwho, where, when, what, and whys\u201d of birdwatching.\n\nLifeList is pre-stoked with 938 bird entries. Following the naming convention for bird orders developed by the American Birding Association, LifeList-Birds is as essential as a Field Guide for recording all of the birds that you've seen in your lifetime.\n\nLifeList\n\n- 938 alphabetically-listed vernacular birds names, along with scientific family names\n- Complete integration with webOS 3 Just Type\n- Add, Edit, and Delete your sighting data\n- Made exclusively for the HP TouchPad and webOS 3\n\nNOTE: LifeList is NOT a field identification guide. You MUST already know the common vernacular name for each bird that you have sighted prior to using LifeList.","version":"2.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/dpwebos.posterous.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/dpwebos.posterous.com\/","custsupportemail":"dp.webos@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Dave Prochnow","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":719810,"installSize":1605632,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T01:18:02.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":true,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":2,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.daveprochnow.lifelist_2.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"9981\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_LifeList_new1.png","screenshot":"9981\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_LifeList_new1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"thumbnail":"9981\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_lifelist_new2.png","screenshot":"9981\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_lifelist_new2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"9981\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_lifelist_new3.png","screenshot":"9981\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_lifelist_new3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"4":{"thumbnail":"9981\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_lifelist_new4.png","screenshot":"9981\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_lifelist_new4.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"5":{"thumbnail":"9981\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_lifelist_new5.png","screenshot":"9981\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_lifelist_new5.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
