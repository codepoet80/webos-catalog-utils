{"publicApplicationId":"com.jakyl.tilestormlite","description":"A hit on iPhone, TileStorm is coming to webOS and this version gives you a chance to sample the game across the 4 unique environments in which it is set.\n\nTileStorm is an extremely addictive puzzle adventure game. TileStorm has beautifully detailed graphics and excellent interactive properties which mean that playing TileStorm is not only fun and rewarding, but it is also a pleasure to look at and play.\n\nThe idea of TileStorm is to solve a series of puzzles enabling 'Eggbot' the robot to make his way through each respective level to the exit. The first puzzles are very similar in appearance and strategy to traditional sliding puzzle games, but later in TileStorm players will encounter tiles with completely different properties, maps with multiple solutions, and levels requiring the re-use of certain tiles. As people play through TileStorm they will find that TileStorm is much more than just a sliding tile game and strategies required in many other games will be needed to complete this game. TileStorm is guaranteed to present a challenge to anyone that plays it and it will require real skill and mental dexterity to complete. TileStorm is set in four beautifully presented themes starting with Industrial then followed by Egypt, Medieval and Jungle.","version":"1.5.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.massivehadron.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.massivehadron.com\/","custsupportemail":"support@massivehadron.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright Andrew Cakebread, Massive Hadron 2009-10","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":9359914,"installSize":35160064,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-06-26T20:29:26.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=p5QF4gEoYcw","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/p5QF4gEoYcw\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.jakyl.tilestormlite_1.5.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"4708\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_ph_screenshot480x320_1.jpg","screenshot":"4708\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_ph_screenshot480x320_1.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"4708\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_ph_screenshot480x320_2.jpg","screenshot":"4708\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_ph_screenshot480x320_2.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"4708\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_ph_screenshot480x320_3.jpg","screenshot":"4708\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_ph_screenshot480x320_3.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"4708\/en\/images\/4\/S\/conv_ph_screenshot480x320_4.jpg","screenshot":"4708\/en\/images\/4\/L\/conv_ph_screenshot480x320_4.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"4708\/en\/images\/5\/S\/conv_ph_screenshot480x320_5.jpg","screenshot":"4708\/en\/images\/5\/L\/conv_ph_screenshot480x320_5.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
