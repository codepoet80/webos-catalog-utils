Preston Peters is willing to pay $5000 to the person who can get it back for him. Discretion is necessary since Peters\u2019 daughter is engaged to Emsworth\u2019s son. Joan Valentine and Ashe Marson both decide to go after the reward\u2014she as Aline Peter\u2019s ladies maid, and he as Mr. Peter\u2019s valet\u2014and they all end up at Blandings Castle. But is it possible for anyone to steal back the scarab with The Efficient Baxter ever vigilant? This is, IMHO, one of Wodehouse\u2019s funniest novels. \u2013Debra Lynn \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
