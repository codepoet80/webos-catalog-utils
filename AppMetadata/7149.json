Thanks to Capt. Crewe\u2019s money, Sara is treated as a little princess until, one day, word comes of her father\u2019s tragic death. Miss Minchin, the school\u2019s greedy headmistress, wastes no time in putting the now-penniless Sara to work for her room and board. It is only through the friendship of two other girls, her own resolute nature, and some astonishing luck that Sara eventually finds her way back to happiness.
