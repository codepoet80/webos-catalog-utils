He wishes to get to the town quickly \u2018for business\u2019. They find themselves in the middle of a blizzard, but the master in his avarice wishes to press on. They eventually get lost off the road and they try to camp. The master\u2019s peasant soon finds himself about to die from hypothermia. The master leaves him on the horse to stubbornly try to find the road. When he returns, he attains a spiritual\/moral revelation, and Tolstoy once again repeats one of his famous themes: that the only true happiness in life is found by living for others.
