World travelers, choose the cities you would like to see & the order you would like to see them in on the main window for an at-a-glance view of the date, time & current weather conditions across multiple cities.    World Weather Watch also provides three day weather forecasts for every city on your list.  Forecast pages are beautifully rendered in full-motion cinematic graphics that show the current weather conditions.  You will see rain streak down your phone\u2019s display, snow flurries whisk by, frost creep over the edges & lightning bolts shoot across the sky. At night you\u2019ll see an accurate depiction of the moon in the correct moon phase.   Finally, World Weather Watch provides a real-time rendered image of the Earth from geosynchronous weather satellites overlaid with real time cloud cover information.  This map also displays where the sun is shining & where it is not so you can track the sunrise as it travels the globe. This view is spectacular for its sheer beauty and as a fascinating way to track global weather patterns.","version":"1.0.8","homeURL":"http:\/\/support.wizardapps.net","supportURL":"http:\/\/support.wizardapps.net","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 WizardApps","licenseURL":"http:\/\/support.wizardapps.net","locale":null,"appSize":"4382632","installSize":"4382632","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.98","currency":"USD","filename":"net.wizardapps.animatedweather_1.0.8_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"1857\/images\/1\/L\/animatedweather_2010-21-02_192958.png","screenshot":"1857\/images\/1\/L\/animatedweather_2010-21-02_192958.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1857\/images\/2\/L\/animatedweather_2010-21-02_193211.png","screenshot":"1857\/images\/2\/L\/animatedweather_2010-21-02_193211.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1857\/images\/3\/L\/animatedweather_2010-21-02_193109.png","screenshot":"1857\/images\/3\/L\/animatedweather_2010-21-02_193109.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
