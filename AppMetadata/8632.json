Unthinkable working conditions and unfair business practices were the norm. The Jungle\u2019s author, Upton Sinclair, was an ardent Socialist of the time. Sinclair was commissioned by the \u201cAppeal To Reason\u201d, a Socialist journal of the period, to write a fictional expose on the working conditions of the immigrant laborers in the meat packing industry in Chicago. Going undercover, Sinclair spent seven weeks inside the meatpacking plants gathering details for his novel.\n\nThe Reader wishes to gratefully acknowledge the assistance, and patience, of Professor Giedrius Subacius (University of Illinois) and the folks at Lituanus (www.lituanus.org) for their invaluable support as I struggled with Lithuanian pronunciations. Truly, this audio book would have been far more difficult, and far less authentic, without their help.\n\nAnd now, feel free to wander into The Jungle\u2026\u2026.(Summary by Tom Weiss) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.5","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"277456","installSize":"277456","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.2","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.thejungleaudio_1.0.5_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"8632\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","screenshot":"8632\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"8632\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","screenshot":"8632\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
