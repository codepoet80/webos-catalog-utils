{"publicApplicationId":"com.speedymarks.palmpre.worldwatchr","description":"Now you can stay in touch with your home, famous places of the world, the current traffic conditions and much more by watching your favorite web cams on your phone.  The World Watchr application makes it easy to monitor web images which are continuously updated (like web camera pictures). It can cycle through all your cameras and updates the images periodically. The images don't have to be produced by webcams. You can monitor any image which is updated over time like weather radars, traffic maps and so on.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.worldwatchr.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.worldwatchr.com","custsupportemail":"info@worldwatchr.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2009 SpeedyMarks","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":120318,"installSize":271391,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2009-12-26T10:47:40.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.speedymarks.palmpre.worldwatchr_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"986\/en\/images\/1\/S\/palmScreenshot.png","screenshot":"986\/en\/images\/1\/L\/palmScreenshot.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"986\/en\/images\/2\/S\/palmScreenshot2.png","screenshot":"986\/en\/images\/2\/L\/palmScreenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"986\/en\/images\/3\/S\/palmScreenshot3.png","screenshot":"986\/en\/images\/3\/L\/palmScreenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
