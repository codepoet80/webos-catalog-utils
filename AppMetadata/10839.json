{"publicApplicationId":"com.juxtaflux.powerlines","description":"A 2 to 4 person multiplayer game, where all players play together on one device.  It's classic face-to-face multiplayer gaming!\n\nLearn to guide your curving Power Line well, and escape your opponents by slipping through the narrow gaps that appear in their Power Lines.  Each player attempts to force their opponents to crash, before they themselves crash.  Last player left alive earns a point and the first to three points wins.  Similar to Tron light cycle style games.\n\nNote: There is a Practice mode available in the game for you to use to practice by yourself.  But, there is no formal single player game mode at this time.\n\nIf you have any issues with the game, please contact us.  We would love to help!\nWeb: http:\/\/www.juxtaflux.com\/contact\nEmail: juxtafluxHelp@gmail.com\nTwitter: @juxtaflux\n\nTechnical note for TouchPad owners:  You may notice a very slight hesitation in the game's animation when players tap the screen.  This is a confirmed bug in HP's webOS software that affects many games in the App Catalog.  This issue is subtle and does not affect gameplay.  But, if you are familiar with webOS homebrew & Preware, you can look into installing the \"Remove Tap Ripple\" patch, as this will remove the animation hesitation.  If you install this patch, you do so at your own risk.  Juxtaflux does not provide any support for homebrew software.\n\n\nKeywords: multiplayer, hotseat, 2 player, 3 player, 4 player, two player, three player, four player, head to head, lightcycle, light cycle, tron, snake, Pre3, Pre 3, Pre2, Pre 2, Pre, Pixi, Veer, TouchPad\n\n(juxtaflux was formerly known as Thing10)\n\nRevision History\n1.1.4 4\/16\/2013 Updated core library code.\n1.1.3 3\/21\/2012 Updated core library code.\n1.1.2 11\/14\/2011 Tweaked intro animation.
