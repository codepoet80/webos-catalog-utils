{"publicApplicationId":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps","description":"GPS MAPS provides the same functionality as the Palm Touchpad App, Giant GPS.  Get all standard GPS parameters and navigate with a reliable odometer and compasses tested in over 10000 miles of travel.  \n\n2 GPS controlled directional compasses and a waypoint finding compass will help you find any location you have been to or plan to visit.  \n\nA robust waypoint management system allows you to save, store & pull statistics on any of the waypoints you have saved.  Waypoints are set either by saving your current location, by tapping on a map or by entering coordinates. \n\nAdditional functions include estimated time of arrival, a tracing of your trail on either a world map or 2d grid and a button that allows you to email your location and approximate address just by entering the recipient's email address.  \n\nThe Palm phone with this GPS app is technology you do not want to miss out on!\n \n**Touchpad owners- while this app is available on the Touchpad, the Giant GPS app is recommended as a more suitable alternative.  For this app and Giant GPS, a Touchpad with G3 telephone capability and a telephone service plan are required.","version":"7.0.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 Disciple Skies Software","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":3572224,"installSize":7438336,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-05T16:50:26.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":3.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps_7.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps\/7.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/320x480_320x480_1_gpsMaps2.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps\/7.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_gpsMaps6.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps\/7.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/320x480_320x480_1_gpsMaps5.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps\/7.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_gpsMaps7.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps\/7.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/320x480_320x480_1_gpsMaps0.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps\/7.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_gpsMaps8.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps\/7.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/320x480_320x480_1_gpsMaps1.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps\/7.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/S\/320x480_75x112_1_gpsMaps1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps\/7.0.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/320x480_320x480_1_gpsMaps3.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.gpsmaps\/7.0.2\/en\/images\/5\/S\/320x480_75x112_1_gpsMaps3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
