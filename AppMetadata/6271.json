{"publicApplicationId":"com.ttpsoft.dailydevopro","description":"Announcing Daily Devo Pro:  the enhanced version of the often downloaded original Daily Devo.  Each day is a beautiful gift! Daily Devo Pro is an app that delivers all the great features of the original Daily Devo app, with a few often requested enhancements.  You still get a different inspirational message and verse from the Bible each day. You still get to choose from several of the most popular Bible versions (Popular versions include New International Version - NIV, King James Version - KJV, New King James Version - NKJV, Amplified Bible - AMP, New American Standard Bible - NASB, American Standard Version - ASV and many others) so that the verse of the day will appear in a format you're comfortable with. You can still use the reminder feature to set the time you'd like to see your daily devotional each day. The PRO version adds the ability to view any Devo from the last six months.  That way you can go back and enjoy a past Devo that had particular meaning for you.  You can now share the current day's Devo or a past Devo with friends & family via email and text message.  The Pro version also doesn't contain ads.
