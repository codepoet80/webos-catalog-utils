{"publicApplicationId":"com.biocandy.swapndrop","description":"Swap & Drop is similar to the popular BeJeweled puzzle games, in which you swap pieces (drag or tap) to make sets of at least three alike pieces. Once a set is made those pieces are removed and the above pieces drop down and new ones drop into place.\nSwap & Drop comes with three game modes: Freeplay, Level and Blitz. And has numerous icon themes such as; Palm\u00ae webOS\u2122, Swap & Drop, Social Web and Donuts. Along with score tracking it also has configurable game settings such as number of pieces (the more pieces the harder the game), board size (5x5, 6x6, and 7x7).","version":"0.6.5","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.biocandy.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.biocandy.com\/labs\/webos\/swapndrop","custsupportemail":"swapndrop@biocandy.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009-2011 Biocandy Labs","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":934242,"installSize":4489216,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T22:18:38.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ku3cx2MAqGQ","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Ku3cx2MAqGQ\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.biocandy.swapndrop_0.6.5_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"579\/0.6.5\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_swapndrop_2009-11-12_180635.png","thumbnail":"579\/0.6.5\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_swapndrop_2009-11-12_180635.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"579\/0.6.5\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_swapndrop_2009-11-12_180817.png","thumbnail":"579\/0.6.5\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_swapndrop_2009-11-12_180817.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"579\/0.6.5\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_swapndrop_2009-11-12_181054.png","thumbnail":"579\/0.6.5\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_swapndrop_2009-11-12_181054.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
