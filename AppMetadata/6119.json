The full version also has the latest listing of landmarks (the lite version is only current through Oct. 2010). ***\n\nBoth versions tell you when each landmark was first designated, provides information from the Landmarks Preservation Commission such as LP number and if it\u2019s in a Historic District, and provides a link to Wikipedia. You can view the location on a map, and email details about the landmark with just a single tap. \n\nFeedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated!","version":"1.5.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/spatialityapps.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/spatialityapps.com\/about\/","custsupportemail":"spatialityapps@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"9178610295","copyright":"Copyright 2010 SpatialityApps","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1138370,"installSize":22740992,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-02-03T00:41:43.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.spatiality.nyclandmarkfinderlite090_1.5.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"6119\/en\/images\/1\/S\/nyclandmarkfinderlite090_2011-02-02_093616.png","screenshot":"6119\/en\/images\/1\/L\/nyclandmarkfinderlite090_2011-02-02_093616.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
