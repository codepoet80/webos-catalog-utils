{"publicApplicationId":"com.wfisher.tedisplay","description":"Available in: English. The TEDisplay application can be used to display power usage information from TED\u00ae 5000 devices. TEDisplay's real-time display provides information on the current power, cost, voltage and CO2 emission as measured by the TED (The Energy Detective) device as well as providing historical information for either the current day or current month. TEDisplay supports multi-MTU systems and performs many of the functions of the TED 5000 wireless display.\n\nYou must already have a TED 5000 system installed in your home for this application to work for you. The TEDisplay application requires network access to the TED 5000 gateway device. Typically, this would mean that TEDisplay will work within your home over your WiFi network but can work outside your home via port forwarding on your in-home router.","version":"1.3.2","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.fisherlea.com\/products\/tedisplay","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.fisherlea.com\/products\/tedisplay","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011, Fisherlea Systems","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.fisherlea.com\/products\/tedisplay","locale":null,"appSize":"253682","installSize":"253682","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"0.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.wfisher.tedisplay_1.3.2_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"com.wfisher.tedisplay\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_TED-SS-Overview.png","screenshot":"com.wfisher.tedisplay\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_TED-SS-Overview.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.wfisher.tedisplay\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_TED-SS-Power.png","screenshot":"com.wfisher.tedisplay\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_TED-SS-Power.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.wfisher.tedisplay\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_TED-SS-Cost.png","screenshot":"com.wfisher.tedisplay\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_TED-SS-Cost.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.wfisher.tedisplay\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_TED-SS-Voltage.png","screenshot":"com.wfisher.tedisplay\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_TED-SS-Voltage.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.wfisher.tedisplay\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_TED-SS-CO2.png","screenshot":"com.wfisher.tedisplay\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_TED-SS-CO2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
