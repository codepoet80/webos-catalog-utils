{"publicApplicationId":"com.spyderspeak.findfood","description":"Find Food is a simple and free way for you to find restaurants near you.  **Update: thank you for your feedback.  I am updating the app to hopefully make the queries better.  If you have any issues please look at the help page or send an email to the support address (located on the help page).  Keep sending feedback so I can keep making the app better!  Thank you.**  The application determines your location, you choose the type of restaurant you want to find and push a button - it's that easy.  If your current location is not where you want to eat you can enter in the location you desire.  You also have the option to save your current address to use later.  In addition to that you have a number of options available to you with each result: Phone number, text, email, map, more...  Clicking on the phone number opens up the phone application with the restaurants phone number, text\/email opens up the texting\/email  applications with the restaurants information (so you don't have to type it in), Map It opens up the Maps application to the restaurants address, and More... opens up the browser to the restaurants review page.  The best part is that it's free.","version":"1.1.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.spyderspeak.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.spyderspeak.com\/app\/findfood\/","custsupportemail":"support@spyderspeak.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Spyder Speak","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":30586,"installSize":3097489,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-07-20T02:28:18.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.spyderspeak.findfood_1.1.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2533\/en\/images\/1\/S\/findfood_2010-11-04_140039.png","screenshot":"2533\/en\/images\/1\/L\/findfood_2010-11-04_140039.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"2533\/en\/images\/2\/S\/findfood_2010-11-04_134154.png","screenshot":"2533\/en\/images\/2\/L\/findfood_2010-11-04_134154.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"2533\/en\/images\/3\/S\/findfood_2010-11-04_135313.png","screenshot":"2533\/en\/images\/3\/L\/findfood_2010-11-04_135313.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"2533\/en\/images\/4\/S\/findfood_2010-11-04_134532.png","screenshot":"2533\/en\/images\/4\/L\/findfood_2010-11-04_134532.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"2533\/en\/images\/5\/S\/findfood_2010-11-04_134131.png","screenshot":"2533\/en\/images\/5\/L\/findfood_2010-11-04_134131.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
