Daily Bible Pro keeps your place if you read ahead or skip a day. Daily Bible Pro only shows you the current passages, so you never get stressed out looking at the whole list. If you choose to change your reading plan, Daily Bible Pro will save your place and start whichever new plan you select. Tap to read the passage in your selected version\/translation (english only) on the web (biblegateway.com), copy the reference to the clipboard, or share your reading on facebook. Be aggressive and complete the entire bible in 90 days. Or try a year-long plan with readings only 5 days a week.
