These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\n    The Art of Public Speaking  by Dale Carnagay (aka Carnegie) and Joseph B. Esenwein is a manual for people who have to speak in public, and it is still in use today. Whether the occasion in question is sharing travel experiences with friends, a toast for newly-weds, or a public debate, the tips and tricks collected in this book will come handy anywhere.\n\n    The book describes how to make effective use of one's voice and gestures, how to gain and convey confidence in front of a large audience, and which methods to use to convert the listeners to one's own cause. Each chapter contains examples and a list of practice exercises. The last 15 sections are real speeches by famous men to function as a study aid. (Summary by Availle) \n\n\n\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.5","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"288192","installSize":"288192","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.2","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.theartofpublicspeakingaudio_1.0.5_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"8596\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","screenshot":"8596\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"8596\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","screenshot":"8596\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
