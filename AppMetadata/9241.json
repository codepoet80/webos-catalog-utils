{"publicApplicationId":"com.gameamour.vampirewerewolfhd","description":"The object of the game is to have control of the most terrain. Each turn you can move\/clone one warrior to a tile. If that tile is adjacent to any enemy tiles, it will take control over them. \n\nSTORY: \nCenturies ago, the humans were populating this devastated planet, but it all changed. Evil spirits were awakened and all the human race became extinct. The two new races, Vampires and Werewolves, were born by infecting the blood of a being. \n\nFEATURES: \n- 2 levels of difficulty: Chieftain and Warlord; \n- Hot Seat MultiPlayer - challenge your friend! \n- Unlimited re-playability; \n- Random maps. \n\nREVIEWS: \n- \"...Vampires vs Werewolves, thanks to the short length of play, finds a nice balance here, and the visual style of the game does give you a bit more intrigue as you start to play... They've got a well implemented board game here that's quick to play, has sufficient depth to let skill and not luck win a game, and for me that's enough to let Vampires vs Werewolves stay on my device.\" -- Ewan Spence, AllAboutSymbian, April 2011. \n\nFOLLOW US: \n Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/GameAmour","version":"1.0.7","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/gameamour.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/gameamour.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Game Amour, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":4858048,"installSize":10878976,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T23:16:12.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":2.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.gameamour.vampirewerewolfhd_1.0.7_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9241\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_VW_screen_1024x768_1.png","thumbnail":"9241\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_VW_screen_1024x768_1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"9241\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_VW_screen_1024x768_3.png","thumbnail":"9241\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_VW_screen_1024x768_3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"9241\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_VW_screen_1024x768_4.png","thumbnail":"9241\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_VW_screen_1024x768_4.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
