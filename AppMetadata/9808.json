{"publicApplicationId":"de.knoopnet.thinfiledit","description":"This app is the advanced version of the free app 'thinFileViewer' and gives you nearly complete control over the contents of the tPad's ssd. 'ThinFileEditor' has 3 special capablities:\n1. It enables you to browse all contents of the tPad's 'ssd'.\n2. You may create text files & edit them (or the extractable text of other files) and save them on the part of your ssd that is also accessible via usb for 'offline' working.\n3. Working with locally stored .html files is also provided:\nYou may create and edit them, check their layout preview and display them in the webOS browser to test links or 'javascript' code.\nDue to webOS related performance reasons this app saves files up to 64 kB.\nNavigating through the directories is provided via buttons to prevent inputs by mistake. The order of the names within a directory is determined by the 'inodes' webOS works with.\nIf a file is 'viewed' in 'hex'-mode the left side will show all characters that are printable in webOS or a red 'I'. 'tab', 'line feet' or 'carriage return' are also masked to avoid layout issues.\nBlue characters indicate a 'non-ascii-standard'.\nThe center contains the 'hexadecimal' code: red characters show that there is a 'double-value' byte which is displayed after each line and yellow 'hh' represent byte code 65533 (hxFFFD).\nText and 'html' editing is realized similary to other simple editors. Since the last update of webOs edited text unfortunately looks a little bit 'stonewashed': this 'issue' will be fixed as soon as webOs supports improved text rendering.\nIn case of problems, remarks or questions concerning this app don't hesitate to send an email to webmaster[at]knoopnet.de","version":"1.4.8","versionNote":"This update makes the app ready for the next webOs update. Additionally basic formatting help by 'spaces' is provided and editing html-code with embedded javascript is accelerated.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.knoopnet.de\/apps","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.knoopnet.de\/apps\/thFed.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 knoopnet.de","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":33316,"installSize":360448,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T04:42:46.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"de.knoopnet.thinfiledit_1.4.8_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9808\/1.4.8\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_thinf1.png","thumbnail":"9808\/1.4.8\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_thinf1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"9808\/1.4.8\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_thinf2.png","thumbnail":"9808\/1.4.8\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_thinf2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"9808\/1.4.8\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_thinf3.png","thumbnail":"9808\/1.4.8\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_thinf3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"4":{"thumbnail":"9808\/1.4.8\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_thinf5.png","screenshot":"9808\/1.4.8\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_thinf5.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"5":{"thumbnail":"9808\/1.4.8\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_thinf4.png","screenshot":"9808\/1.4.8\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_thinf4.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
