These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nMansfield Park features Austen\u2019s frailest and perhaps most scrupulous heroine, Fannie Price. As the eldest daughter in a poor family, Fannie is sent to rich relatives when she\u2019s just old enough to fully appreciate the shame of her circumstances. Without pride or prejudice, Fanny sticks to principles in all matters. And matters certainly put her to the test. (Summary by Anita) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"280124","installSize":"280124","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.2","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.mansfieldparkaudio_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7334\/images\/1\/L\/mansfieldpark1.png","screenshot":"7334\/images\/1\/L\/mansfieldpark1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7334\/images\/2\/L\/mansfieldpark2.png","screenshot":"7334\/images\/2\/L\/mansfieldpark2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
