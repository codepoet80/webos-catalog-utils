{"publicApplicationId":"net.palmdoc.chemconverter","description":"This application works out the conversion between US and SI units for various chemistry values commonly used in medical practice. Items are presented in a scrolling list in the main screen and selected by tapping on it. You can filter your choice by typing. To perform a conversion, just type in a value in either the US or SI unit field, hit Enter or tap anywhere else on the screen, and the other field will show the converted value. \nThe conversion factor is displayed for each item at the bottom.\nThe program provides some additional information including links to informative websites (an Internet connection is required for these) and in some cases normal or reference values. Please note that the normal values provided may differ from your local laboratory's reference range so you should always consult with your local lab.\n\nPurchase of this app supports our efforts in producing medical webOS apps, the majority of which are free.
