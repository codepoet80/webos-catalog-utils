{"publicApplicationId":"com.eclecticdesignstudio.haxedemo","description":"The haXe \"demo\" was the original test bed for porting the haXe development framework to webOS. The port has been a success!\n\nYou can view games which have been created using haXe, like MineHX, Hoops, Whack A Mole and Paper Basketball. Even more are coming!\n\nhaXe applications for webOS can cross-compile to Flash or webOS, or even iPhone, Android, Windows, Mac OS or Linux.\n\nPlease feel free to try any of the other haXe-based games, or to download and try out this physics demonstration! Press 1-6 on your keyboard to initiate different physics simulations. Tap your screen to fire blocks to mix things up. Tests 2-6 are connected to the accelerometer, so tip your phone to play with gravity.","version":"0.4.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.eclecticdesignstudio.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.eclecticdesignstudio.com","custsupportemail":"info@eclecticdesignstudio.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Eclectic Design Studio","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1415056,"installSize":4980736,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-02-09T10:14:43.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.eclecticdesignstudio.haxedemo_0.4.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"4207\/en\/images\/1\/S\/Screenshot_020.png","screenshot":"4207\/en\/images\/1\/L\/Screenshot_020.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"4207\/en\/images\/2\/S\/Screenshot2_020.png","screenshot":"4207\/en\/images\/2\/L\/Screenshot2_020.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"4207\/en\/images\/3\/S\/Screenshot3_020.png","screenshot":"4207\/en\/images\/3\/L\/Screenshot3_020.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
