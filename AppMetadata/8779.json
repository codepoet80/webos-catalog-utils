He made it a habit to never \u2018write down\u2019 to children and frequently used words beyond the average juvenile vocabulary, believing that youngsters respond to the stimulus of the unfamiliar.\u201d\n(Summary by http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arthur_Scott_Bailey) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
