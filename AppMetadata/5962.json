{"publicApplicationId":"com.reverie.armory","description":"NOTICE: Blizzard has not yet updated their XML feeds, so some data is still not displaying correctly. This includes worgen\/goblin portraits, level 85 portraits, mastery stats, and possibly some other data. The app is still functional other than these minor issues. There will be an update once Blizzard fixes things on their end. Thank you for your patience in this matter. --- \n \nThe WoW Armory Viewer allows you to view your characters on the World of Warcraft Armory in a format designed for your mobile device. All data loads in an interface made for a touchscreen, allowing you to easily view characters' items, talents, activity feed, and more. It also shows information the standard Armory doesn't (prime glyphs, secondary professions...) and even loads faster. Supports US and EU Armories. (The maker of this app is in no way affiliated with Blizzard Entertainment.)\n --- If you have any problems with the app, please send an email to armoryhelp@reverierealms.us. I am unable to respond to reviews.","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/reverierealms.us","supportURL":"http:\/\/reverierealms.us\/products\/wow-armory-viewer\/","custsupportemail":"armoryhelp@reverierealms.us","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":23180,"installSize":688128,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T10:43:33.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.reverie.armory_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"5962\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ss1.png","thumbnail":"5962\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ss1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"5962\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ss2.png","thumbnail":"5962\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ss2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"5962\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ss3.png","thumbnail":"5962\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ss3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
