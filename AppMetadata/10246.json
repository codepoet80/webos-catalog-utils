{"publicApplicationId":"com.smashedfly.classicpongfree","description":"CLASSIC PONG FREE with NO ADS. It looks like any other pong game out there, but this pong game has better features and plays better than the original or most pong games out there. Pong is all about angles, so that's what I improved. The paddles are using a convex formula. The problem with most of the clones is that the ball just bounces in the opposite direction, like a laser reflecting off of a mirror. With convex paddles you have more control of the ball so it's a lot more challenging. *** Now with game statistics, winning streaks, point streaks and more. ***","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.smashedfly.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.smashedfly.com","custsupportemail":"mike@millerszone.com","custsupportphonenum":"5025508597","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Smashedfly","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":853526,"installSize":2555904,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-08-23T11:16:13.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.smashedfly.classicpongfree_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10246\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_Image1.png","thumbnail":"10246\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_Image1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"10246\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_Image2.png","thumbnail":"10246\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_Image2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"10246\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_Image4.png","thumbnail":"10246\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_Image4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"10246\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_Image3.png","thumbnail":"10246\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_Image3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
