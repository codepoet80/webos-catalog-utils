{"publicApplicationId":"com.copperfrog.parkingcookie","description":"Parking Cookie lets you easily record where you parked for future reference. Unlike other GPS-based parking utilities that don't work in garages or when satellites are unavailable, this utility is based on free-form text input. Examples of this include: \"Term A Level 5 Pole C3\", \"West Lot 4A\", \"720 Main St St Paul MN\", and \"37.76 -122.40\". The Map It button will launch Google Maps with the entered location as input, so that any address or GPS-based location will be mapped.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/cufrog\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/cufrog\/","custsupportemail":"copperfrogess@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"2812561339","copyright":"copyright 2010 Copperfrog","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":62878,"installSize":1309705,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T04:07:10.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.copperfrog.parkingcookie_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"3957\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/PCookie.jpg","thumbnail":"3957\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/PCookie.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
