{"publicApplicationId":"org.thegunns.dofcalchd","description":"***Half price for a limited time***\nA depth of field calculator can help photographers to figure out how much of their picture will be in focus. \n\nDepth of Field is a measure of how far in front or behind the focus point an object can be and still be in focus in an image. \n\nDepth of Field is determined by: \n- camera sensor size \n- lens focal length \n- lens aperture \n- subject distance \n\nIf the focus distance is set to the hyperfocal distance, the image will have the largest depth of field possible for that sensor, focal length & aperture. \n\nFor example, a landscape photographer may want to have the entire scene in focus, so they would choose to focus at the hyperfocal distance so that everything from the close foreground to the distant horizon would appear in sharp focus in the final image. \n\nOn the other hand, a portrait photographer may want to use a very shallow depth of field so that distracting elements in the background will be blurred out of focus and not detract attention from the subject of the portrait.","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.thegunns.org\/webos\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.thegunns.org\/webos\/","custsupportemail":"dof@thegunns.org","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011, Chris Gunn","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":35658,"installSize":655360,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T01:18:36.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"org.thegunns.dofcalchd_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"org.thegunns.dofcalchd\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/768x1024_320x480_tb_dofcalchd_2011-26-07_205355.png","screenshot":"org.thegunns.dofcalchd\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_dofcalchd_2011-26-07_205355.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"org.thegunns.dofcalchd\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_dofcalchd_2011-26-07_205513.png","thumbnail":"org.thegunns.dofcalchd\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_dofcalchd_2011-26-07_205513.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"org.thegunns.dofcalchd\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_dofcalchd_2011-26-07_205616.png","thumbnail":"org.thegunns.dofcalchd\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_dofcalchd_2011-26-07_205616.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
