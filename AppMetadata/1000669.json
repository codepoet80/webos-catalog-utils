{"publicApplicationId":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123","description":"\u2018Peg Puzzle: abc 123\u2019 is a digital take on the classic children\u2019s wooden peg puzzle toys. A fun and interactive way of learning, the game helps to develop fine motor skills, hand eye coordination, logical thinking skills and can also be used as a tool to help develop vocabulary.\n\nThe object of the game is simple, the player simply has to drag and drop the correct letter or number into the correct space. When a letter or number is first picked up its name is read aloud in a clear child friendly voice. The letters and numbers have been designed using a child friendly font which aids in learning the correct letter and number formation. The letters and numbers have each been given a bright and engaging colour which will appeal to the child.\n\nEach time the game is loaded six random letters or numbers are selected and laid out on the board. This gives thousands of possible combinations giving hours of fun. Once complete the game can be started over or the player can load a new random set of shapes from the current category. The game is split into three categories lowercase letters a \u2013 z, uppercase letters A- Z and numbers 1 \u2013 20.\n\nEach time a right answer is achieved the player is rewarded by a visual and audio response and when all six spaces have been correctly filled the player receives a round of applause. This helps to build a sense of achievement which the child will wish to repeat again and again.\n\nIt is believed that shape recognition and matching skills play an important role in mathematical development. Matching is also an important skill for young children to develop because it is an essential pre-reading skill.\n\nThe app is designed specifically for young children and has been tested by a range of 2 \u2013 4 year olds. All buttons and menus are designed to be easy to use and self explanatory.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.pulseapps.co.uk","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.pulseapps.co.uk","custsupportemail":"info@pulseapps.co.uk","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 Pulse Apps","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":6614090,"installSize":20054016,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2013-05-04T00:10:31.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_screenshot1.jpg","thumbnail":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_screenshot1.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_screenshot2.jpg","thumbnail":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_screenshot2.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_screenshot3.jpg","thumbnail":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_screenshot3.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_screenshot4.jpg","thumbnail":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_screenshot4.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_screenshot5.jpg","thumbnail":"com.pulse.pegpuzzleabc123\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_screenshot5.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
