{"publicApplicationId":"com.angrygoat.sqzctrl","description":"#1 Remote control app for the SqueezeBox system on WebOS devices. Control your SqueezeBox players from your phone.\nThis app controls Squeezebox players connected to a Squeezebox Server or MySqueezebox.com. (it might work with the SqueezeBox Touch as the server - not tested). Replicates almost every function of a Squeezebox Controller with an interface optimize for a touch screen.\n\nRequirements: Squeezebox Server version 7.4 or better. It won't work with\tanything older. Use version 7.5 or better if you plan on using MySqueezebox.com too. A MySqueezebox.com account is required if you don't use a Squeezebox Server. You can create one from within the app or on the website. And of course Squeezebox players to control.   \n\nv2.1.1:\n- When listing \"All Songs\" the header menu panel will now give you options for the list.\n- [Bug Fixed] The drawers for items in the current playlist were showing the data of wrong items.\n- [Bug Fixed] The header menu panel on the 'Current Playlist' screen does not initially open on long playlists.\n- [Bug Fixed] Alarms could not be set to 12:00AM.\n- [Bug Fixed] Switching to different server from the 'Connection Error' now works.\n- [Bug Fixed] Correctly handle when trying to connect with 'Use Local' on, but with no defined servers.\n- Internal tweaks to better handle unexpected responses from the server.\n- Slight tweak to better deal with changes in Squeezebox Server 2.5.4\n\nNotes:\nUse a wifi connection if possible. A mobile data connection would work if the server is setup correctly, but the performance may not be acceptable.\nWhen connected, this app is constantly communicating with the server. If you're using a mobile data connection, this may incur a significant data usage fee.\nTested with the SqueezeBox Receiver & Boom. Other devices should at least be controllable, but some menu items may not function correctly.\nServer discovery is not yet available, but will be added in a later update.","version":"2.1.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.angrygoatapps.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.angrygoatapps.com","custsupportemail":"info@angrygoatapps.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010-2011 Wayne Tam","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":284558,"installSize":7143424,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-07-05T18:54:58.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":true,"universalSearch":true,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":9.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.angrygoat.sqzctrl_2.1.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2759\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_01.jpg","screenshot":"2759\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_01.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"2759\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_02.jpg","screenshot":"2759\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_02.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"2759\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_03.jpg","screenshot":"2759\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_03.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"2759\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_04.jpg","screenshot":"2759\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_04.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"2759\/en\/images\/5\/S\/ph_05.jpg","screenshot":"2759\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_05.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
