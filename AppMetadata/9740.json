{"publicApplicationId":"com.god.is","description":"What is God in a world filled with hurting and pain? God is good still. God is just in his ways. God is never failing, but why sometimes is it so hard to believe in the troubled times we all face? It's because we're humans, it's because we are free to believe what we want. When we can't 'feel' God in our lives, don't we all tend to walk away from Him? The thing is god is reaching out to all of us, in the good times and in the bad, that's what this app is all about.","version":"0.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/lionboystudios.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.lionboystudios.com","custsupportemail":"lionboystudios@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Lion Boy Studio, God is.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1130864,"installSize":2523136,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T00:43:59.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.god.is_0.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":[]}
