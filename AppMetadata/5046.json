{"publicApplicationId":"com.naggel.whistle","description":"!!!NEW: MORE FREQUENCIES NOW!!! Do you want your dog or other animals to react and obey to you, or do you just want them to stop barking? Use Ultimate Dog Whistle to play a high frequency tone that makes any animal immediately aware of you. You can choose between frequencies ranging from 8 kHz up to 22 kHz. This way you have the ability to select the frequency that best suits you and your pet. Tap the Start and Stop button to only play the sound when you want it to play. You can use this app to train your dog, cat or other animal to the frequency you set in this app, or you can just set this whistle app to the frequency your target animal is trained to. The higher the frequency, the better the animals and the lesser humans can hear the frequency. This app is free and will forever stay free. If you like this app, please write a review.
