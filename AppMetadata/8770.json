These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nThe Story of the Pony Express  offers an in depth account behind the need for a mail route to connect the eastern U.S. with the rapidly populating west coast following the gold rush of California, the springing up of lumber camps, and all incidental needs arising from the settling of the western frontier. Here we learn of the inception of the Pony Express, its formation, successes, failures, facts, statistics, combined with many anecdotes and names of the people who were an integral part of this incredible entity which lasted but less than two years, yet was instrumental in the successful settlement of two thirds of the land mass comprising the expanding country. (Introduction by Roger Melin) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.5","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"300456","installSize":"300456","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.2","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.thestoryoftheponyexpressaudio_1.0.5_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"8770\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","screenshot":"8770\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"8770\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","screenshot":"8770\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
