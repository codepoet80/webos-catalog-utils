That's the gag.\n\n\nNote: If you have download problems, please contact HP\/Palm. Well, If you have problems with our app, contact us via Email to fix your issue fast. \n\nIf you feel the app is funny, write us a fair rating in the app catalog...\n\nThis trial version is free to download.","version":"1.2.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/tamoggemon.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/tamoggemon.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"(c) Simon Pfundstein 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/tamoggemon.com","locale":null,"appSize":"295836","installSize":"295836","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":0,"currency":"USD","filename":"appcatalog.trial.tamoggemon.realitygun_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":true,"images":[{"thumbnail":"8436\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_Screenshot01.png","screenshot":"8436\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_Screenshot01.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"8436\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_Screenshot02.png","screenshot":"8436\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_Screenshot02.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"8436\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_Screenshot03.png","screenshot":"8436\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_Screenshot03.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"8436\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_Screenshot04.png","screenshot":"8436\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_Screenshot04.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
