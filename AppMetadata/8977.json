{"publicApplicationId":"com.webonastick.flap-clock-3000.free","description":"Flap Clock 3000 is now free! As in beer! You can purchase the paid edition of this app if you would like to give enough money to buy a good cup of coffee to your humble author. The paid edition may or may not contain features beyond the free edition at any time. Thanks! :-)\n\nA flip clock you'll have loads of fun with, especially if you're fidgety like me, or just like flip clocks, like me.\n\nDisplays 12- or 24-hour time depending on your Date & Time settings.  At your option, can hide the seconds and the date.  Adapts to your device's screen orientation.  The ticking sound can optionally be disabled; its volume is controlled by the standard system sounds volume in your Sounds & Ringtones settings.\n\nDrag the numbers to change the time, then shake or use the back gesture to reset back to regular time.  This fidgety feature was influenced by FlipTime XL, an app by omletworks available for iOS devices.\n\nBy default, this application keeps the screen on while it is active.\n\nHave fun, and thanks!\n\nv1.4.1 is no different from v1.4.0 except for metainfo to differentiate the free version from the paid version.\n\n&","version":"1.4.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/webonastick.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/webonastick.com\/flap-clock-3000\/","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010\u20132011 Darren Embry","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":27254,"installSize":1540096,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-05-19T09:18:20.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x-5nZJAuof4","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/x-5nZJAuof4\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":true,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.webonastick.flap-clock-3000.free_1.4.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"8977\/en\/images\/1\/S\/screenshot1.png","screenshot":"8977\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"8977\/en\/images\/2\/S\/screenshot2.png","screenshot":"8977\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"8977\/en\/images\/3\/S\/screenshot3.png","screenshot":"8977\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"8977\/en\/images\/4\/S\/screenshot4.png","screenshot":"8977\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screenshot4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
