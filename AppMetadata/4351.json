Tell CS what items you want to search for, set filter criteria, and how often to do the search, and Craig's Secretary will search CraigsList, and notify you of new results. \n\nEasily scroll through listings, or reply to poster with one tap. \nFlag postings for viewing later. Double Tap to zoom in on photos or other text, just like when using the web browser.\n\nTo get started doing a quick search, enter search location, category, and search phrase. Then press Search. CS will search CraigsList for appropriate matches. Or, save as an auto search by entering the duration. \n\nTo alter saved searches, go to auto searches, and tap on appropriate saved search. \n\nTo flag a result, press the flag button when viewing a result. \n\nUpdates: 1.0.5:  1.) CS Pro now remembers your last location, so you needn't enter it each time. 2.) Supports landscape mode. 3.) Fixed bug where auto searches couldn't be deleted. 4.) Added the ability to select 12 hour and daily searches.\nUpdate 1.08: Fixed bug that disabled auto search. Also lowered price.\nNext update will allow background auto searches.","version":"1.0.9","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/forums.precentral.net\/email-companion\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/forums.precentral.net\/email-companion\/","custsupportemail":"ccdoss@optionsprosperity.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright Options Prosperity","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":258900,"installSize":3375104,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T08:25:06.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.gatecitycoders.craigssecretarypro_1.0.9_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"4351\/1.0.9\/en\/images\/1\/L\/craigssecretary_2010-27-07_215849.png","thumbnail":"4351\/1.0.9\/en\/images\/1\/L\/craigssecretary_2010-27-07_215849.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"4351\/1.0.9\/en\/images\/2\/L\/craigssecretary_2010-27-07_214834.png","thumbnail":"4351\/1.0.9\/en\/images\/2\/L\/craigssecretary_2010-27-07_214834.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"4351\/1.0.9\/en\/images\/3\/L\/craigssecretary_2010-27-07_220144.png","thumbnail":"4351\/1.0.9\/en\/images\/3\/L\/craigssecretary_2010-27-07_220144.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"4351\/1.0.9\/en\/images\/4\/L\/craigssecretary_2010-27-07_215824.png","thumbnail":"4351\/1.0.9\/en\/images\/4\/L\/craigssecretary_2010-27-07_215824.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"4351\/1.0.9\/en\/images\/5\/L\/craigssecretary_2010-28-07_215705.png","thumbnail":"4351\/1.0.9\/en\/images\/5\/L\/craigssecretary_2010-28-07_215705.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
