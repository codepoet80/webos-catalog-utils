With Super Contacts Plus, you have the ability to group contacts, quickly dial, SMS or email individual contacts, and the power to broadcast an email or SMS to the group or subset of the group without the enforced limitations the in the standard version. Contacts can be globally searched by group name for use in other applications.  The Quick Tap functionality allows you to rapidly cycle through and initiate a call, email or SMS using a configurable list of phone numbers, SMS numbers and email addresses for a contact. Contact information is automatically populated using the contact information on your phone. Flicking the contact left or right gives you additional options for contacting that contact. The group tab names, colors and order are customizable. The contact list on a tab can be rapidly filtered by tapping the letter associated with the editable display name. The Mini view and \"Minimize to Dashboard\" make it quick and easy to access your contacts.  Left and Right handed configurations.
