{"publicApplicationId":"com.craigwarner.life","description":"Life Simulator is a mathematical game that simulates a colony of single celled animals.  You, the user of the life simulator, input the initial location of single celled animals.  You then advance time to see the fate of your colony.\nThe game \"Life\" was invented in 1970 by the Cambridge University mathematician John Conway. \n\nLife Simulator lets the user control many features.  The \nimage used to represent life, the speed at which time advances, as well as wrapping in the x and y dimensions are all configurable.  In this new version (1.1) of Life Simulator, the world is now 40 by 40 cells large letting you place\nmore interesting shapes like \u201cGlider Guns\u201d and \u201cPulsars\u201d.  An initial\nLife Pattern scene was also added to let you pick the initial life pattern,\nBoth the \u201cGlider Gun\u201d and \u201cPulsar\u201d are included as predefined \npatterns you can select. You can also save your own favorite patterns.","version":"2.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/mysite.verizon.net\/cg_warner\/webos","supportURL":"http:\/\/mysite.verizon.net\/cg_warner\/webos\/life","custsupportemail":"cg_warner@verizon.net","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":159304,"installSize":2031616,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-08-17T10:03:44.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.craigwarner.life_2.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"4476\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_ss1.png","thumbnail":"4476\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_ss1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"thumbnail":"4476\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_ss2.png","screenshot":"4476\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_ss2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"4476\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_ss3.png","screenshot":"4476\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_ss3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
