If you still have problems please email us.]\n\nThe sequel to TileStorm and already a hit on iPhone, in TileStorm Eire, Eggbot has gone to Ireland, the land of his forefathers, to make his fortune and to do some sightseeing. Eggbot hopes to earn a thousand gold coins before he returns home, but he needs your help. To help Eggbot you will need to guide Eggbot through every county in Ireland. Eggbot is not sure of the way though, so you need to make the paths for him to follow. Not all paths lead to gold, and some counties have hidden gold. The last counties have more difficult tiles as well, but you won't have to worry how long you take, because Eggbot is very patient.\n\nEggbot's Irish Adventure is guaranteed to present a challenge to anyone that plays it and it will require real skill and mental dexterity to complete. At the same time though players of all ages will be able to enjoy adventuring through Ireland in this beautifully presented game. Eggbot's Irish Adventure is set in 32 stunning levels one for each county in Ireland. Many of the levels have unique content in keeping with the many famous sights to be found in Ireland, including the orchards of County Armagh, the New Grange of County Meath, and the Spire of Dublin. As well as really famous sights like the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, and Blarney Castle of County Cork. \n\nThere are also some extra puzzles for bonus gold, that are completely optional, but present a really interesting and unique challenge.\n\nPlease note that part of the puzzle is that certain tiles can't be moved, or can only be moved under certain conditions!","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.massivehadron.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.massivehadron.com\/","custsupportemail":"support@massivehadron.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009-10 Andrew Cakebread, Massive Hadron","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":6235578,"installSize":27033600,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-09-16T14:48:19.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.jakyl.tilestormeire_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"4881\/en\/images\/1\/S\/Screenshot1.jpg","screenshot":"4881\/en\/images\/1\/L\/Screenshot1.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"4881\/en\/images\/2\/S\/Screenshot2.jpg","screenshot":"4881\/en\/images\/2\/L\/Screenshot2.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"4881\/en\/images\/3\/S\/Screenshot3.jpg","screenshot":"4881\/en\/images\/3\/L\/Screenshot3.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"4881\/en\/images\/4\/S\/Screenshot4.jpg","screenshot":"4881\/en\/images\/4\/L\/Screenshot4.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
