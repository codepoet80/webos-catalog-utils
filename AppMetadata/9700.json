{"publicApplicationId":"com.scrollmotion.dontgettoocomfortable-9780307375070-rhca","description":"In \"Don't Get Too Comfortable\", Rakoff journeys into the land of plenty that is contemporary North America. Rarely have greed, vanity, selfishness, and vapidity been so mercilessly and wittily portrayed. Whether contrasting the elegance of one of the last flights of the supersonic Concorde with the good times and chicken wings of Hooters Air, portraying the rarified universe of Paris fashion shows where an evening dress can cost as much as four years of college, or traveling to a private island off the coast of Belize to watch a soft-core Playboy TV shoot, where he is provided with his very own personal manservant, David Rakoff takes us on a bitingly funny grand tour of our culture of excess, delving into the manic getting and spending that defines the North American way of life. Somewhere along the line, our healthy self-regard has exploded into obliterating narcissism, and Rakoff is there to map that frontier.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"5386028","installSize":"5386028","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"12.95","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.dontgettoocomfortable-9780307375070-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9700\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9700\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9700\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9700\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9700\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9700\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
