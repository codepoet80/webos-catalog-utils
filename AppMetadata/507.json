{"publicApplicationId":"com.rockus.micoqui","description":"English Only. Mi Coqui plays relaxing coqui sounds with faint rain in the background to help Puerto Ricans living abroad fall asleep.  You can play the coquis endlessly or set a timer to put them to sleep after they've helped you doze off.  Now you can finally close your eyes and imagine you're back in \"La Isla del Encanto\". Use it for a quick siesta or for a deep night's sleep.","version":"1.2.8","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.rockus-studios.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.rockus-studios.com","custsupportemail":"support@rockus-studios.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Rockus Studios, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":656908,"installSize":2523136,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T16:15:21.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.rockus.micoqui_1.2.8_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"507\/1.2.8\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot1.png","thumbnail":"507\/1.2.8\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
