{"publicApplicationId":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook","description":"From the studio of Lowell Davis comes the enchanting story of Big Jack, Goldie, and the other residents of a real farm in southwest Missouri.  Sprinkled with bits of farm lore and humor, the story of Big Jack and Goldie's romance, courtship, and marriage preserves the values of a simpler time -- a way of life that many of us remember and long for.  \n\nBut Big Jack & Goldie is more than just a farm tale. It's a full-color collection of artwork by one of the world's most famous rural and collectables artists, Lowell Davis.  For nearly two decades his reputation as a sculptor and painter has earned him numerous accolades - especially for his works of chickens.  And his art, characters,setting, and story all create a magical world of yesterday,much like Davis's own self-created world of his 1930's-era farm in the Ozarks.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.invasivebamboo.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.invasivebamboo.com\/Contact.aspx","custsupportemail":"support@invasivebamboo.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009-2012 Invasive Bamboo","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":17557528,"installSize":23658496,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T07:20:58.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_Page02a.jpg","thumbnail":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_Page02a.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_Page19a.jpg","thumbnail":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_Page19a.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_Page30a.jpg","thumbnail":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_Page30a.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_Page39a.jpg","thumbnail":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_Page39a.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_Lowell.jpg","thumbnail":"com.invasivebamboo.chickenbook\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_Lowell.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
