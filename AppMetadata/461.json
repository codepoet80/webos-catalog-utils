{"publicApplicationId":"com.vocshop.snowglobe","description":"A major update to this customizable snow globe with your images in it.  This version resolves early reviewers problems with slow performance.  You can Shake your phone to make it snow!  Dance to the music box music by giving the screen a little tap.  Mix it up! You can select any of the three hand-drawn snow globes, and ANY image on your phone as a background. Adjust your images to fit the viewport by pinching or spreading the screen. But if your image is smaller than the view port the image will not fill the globe.  Images larger than the viewport can be adjusted using pinch and spread gestures. We hope you enjoy our Snow Globe, and look forward to meeting you again in our next game.
