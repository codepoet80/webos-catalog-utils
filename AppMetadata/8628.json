These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nTheir Mutual Child (aka The Coming of Bill and The White Hope) is full of the loveable characters, preposterous situations, and opportunities to chuckle, if not outright laughs, that we expect from PG Wodehouse. It lacks the frantic slapstick of some Wodehouse comedy, but has a quieter more reflective humour. \nTheir Mutual Child aka The Coming of Bill or The White Hope by P. G. Wodehouse, first appeared in \u201cMunsey's Magazine\u201d in May 1914, under the title \"The White Hope.\u201d It was published in the U.S. under the title Their Mutual Child in 1919, and in the U.K. with the title, The Coming of Bill in 1920. (Introduction by Susan Claybrook and Tim Bulkeley with information from the Wikipedia entry.)  \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
