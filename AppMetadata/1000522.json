{"publicApplicationId":"com.warlord.pop","description":"Like the name 'Balloon go Boom' suggests, all you really need to do is pop a group of balloons.\n\nThe only trick is that the balloons have to be grouped together before you pop them. The balloons come in four different colours \u2013 red, green, blue, and orange.\n\nSo you have to group the balloons according to their colours and then attempt to pop them either vertically or horizontally. A group has to have a minimum of two balloons.","version":"1.1.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/cmcgraw.home.insightbb.com\/index.html","supportURL":"http:\/\/cmcgraw.home.insightbb.com\/index.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 CMCS.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":348332,"installSize":753664,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T08:40:40.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.warlord.pop_1.1.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.warlord.pop\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_pop_2012-31-01_155714.png","thumbnail":"com.warlord.pop\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_pop_2012-31-01_155714.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.warlord.pop\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_pop_2012-31-01_155727.png","thumbnail":"com.warlord.pop\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_pop_2012-31-01_155727.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.warlord.pop\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_pop_2012-31-01_155745.png","thumbnail":"com.warlord.pop\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_pop_2012-31-01_155745.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.warlord.pop\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_pop_2012-31-01_155813.png","thumbnail":"com.warlord.pop\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_pop_2012-31-01_155813.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
