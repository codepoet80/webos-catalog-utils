{"publicApplicationId":"com.appible.dracula","description":"Dracula is an 1897 novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, featuring as its primary antagonist the vampire Count Dracula. It was first published as a hardcover in 1897 by Archibald Constable and Co. Dracula has been attributed to many literary genres including vampire literature, horror fiction, the gothic novel and invasion literature. Structurally it is an epistolary novel, that is, told as a series of letters, diary entries, ships' logs, etc. Although Stoker did not invent the vampire, the novel's influence on the popularity of vampires has been singularly responsible for many theatrical, film and television interpretations throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. --Wikipedia.org--","version":"1.5.1","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"776048","installSize":"776048","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"0.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.dracula_1.5.1_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"2263\/de\/images\/1\/L\/01dracula.png","screenshot":"2263\/de\/images\/1\/L\/01dracula.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2263\/de\/images\/2\/L\/02dracula.png","screenshot":"2263\/de\/images\/2\/L\/02dracula.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2263\/de\/images\/3\/L\/03dracula.png","screenshot":"2263\/de\/images\/3\/L\/03dracula.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2263\/de\/images\/4\/L\/04dracula.png","screenshot":"2263\/de\/images\/4\/L\/04dracula.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
