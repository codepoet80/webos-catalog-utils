{"publicApplicationId":"com.spm.app.abcs4kids","description":"Version 1.3.0: What's New? --1. Audio is added for Shapes and Colors(Still looking for nicer audio, please be patient). --2.Removed some items from shapes and colors as I could not find audio for that. --3. The ABOUT section is now moved to the menu item so kids cannot accidentally click and send me email. (I received close to 20-30 emails from many peoples' Kids. I am happy that they are playing with this app). NOTE: If anyone needs support please email me and do not write it in the app review as I do not know your email id. As usual please update your app review if the app works for you. If you have any suggestions\/ideas you are welcome to email. ############################# Description: Do you have kids under 3 years of age crawling or just started walking or running around in your house or do you know any kids who are very much interested in ABCs or 123s? If yes then this app comes handy for you. ABCs 4 Kids is an app for parents who want to teach Pre-K related lessons to their kids. I developed and dedicated this app to my kid who is very much a learning enthusiast (until now and hope he stay the same way). ################ I will include other categories down the road. This app is absolutely free so please feel free to use it to entertain your kid. If you have any suggestions\/ideas please do not hesitate to e-mail me or write in the app review. -------From the App Menu you can go to the app catalog to write a review and also you can go to About scene and send me an email. ############# Please note that the app will be updated once in a while as I am developing this in my free time and it takes lot of time\/energy to create various multimedia stuff like images and sounds. Also please note that I am not a professional graphic designer and if someone can help me with the graphic designs that would be great.","version":"1.3.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/spmtechgroup","supportURL":"http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/spmtechgroup","custsupportemail":"solaimadhan@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Madhan Premkumar","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2701576,"installSize":7929856,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-08-20T14:13:22.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.spm.app.abcs4kids_1.3.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"4220\/en\/images\/1\/S\/main.png","screenshot":"4220\/en\/images\/1\/L\/main.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"4220\/en\/images\/2\/S\/Preferences.png","screenshot":"4220\/en\/images\/2\/L\/Preferences.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"4220\/en\/images\/3\/S\/choose-category.png","screenshot":"4220\/en\/images\/3\/L\/choose-category.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"4220\/en\/images\/4\/S\/colors.png","screenshot":"4220\/en\/images\/4\/L\/colors.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
