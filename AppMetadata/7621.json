{"publicApplicationId":"ca.canuckcoding.busgadget","description":"This is a public transit app for Winnipeg Transit.\n\nWinnipeg Transit has a rarely known desktop program called \"BUSgadget\" that lets you choose a stop, and view the upcoming buses scheduled to stop there.\n\nThis is my mobile version.  You can specify the stop number, or search up nearby stops using GPS.  Once a bus stop is selected, upcoming buses are shown, with information like bus route #, bus route variant, & obviously, how long until the bus arrives.\n\nThe keep advantage of this application is that the listed times are based on the GPS on the buses, rather than standard stop schedule time. This way, even early\/late buses will have accurate times shown.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/canuckcoding.ca","supportURL":"http:\/\/canuckcoding.ca","custsupportemail":"support@canuckcoding.ca","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Canuck Coding","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":104958,"installSize":1376256,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-02-17T14:53:11.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"ca.canuckcoding.busgadget_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"7621\/en\/images\/1\/S\/busgadget_2011-13-02_234017.png","screenshot":"7621\/en\/images\/1\/L\/busgadget_2011-13-02_234017.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"7621\/en\/images\/2\/S\/busgadget_2011-13-02_234111.png","screenshot":"7621\/en\/images\/2\/L\/busgadget_2011-13-02_234111.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
