{"publicApplicationId":"com.craigwarner.spinner","description":"Spinner is a program for the HP Touchpad which allows you and a friend to play the Milton Bradley game Twister with just two people.  We all know that, sometimes, three is a crowd. The Touchpad announces colors and body parts, an you play.  If someone falls simply tap the screen or rotate the Touchpad and the program will jump back to the introductory screen.  For advance players, the minimum and maximun delay between spins is configurable to be faster of slower (usually more difficult).  There is also an option for having the Touchpad taunt\/provoke you while you play the game like some human spinners do.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/mysite.verizon.net\/cg_warner\/webos","supportURL":"http:\/\/mysite.verizon.net\/cg_warner\/webos\/spinner\/index.html","custsupportemail":"cg_warner@verizon.net","custsupportphonenum":"9723931421","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":855244,"installSize":7700480,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T01:47:56.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VCGOp8sUyok","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/VCGOp8sUyok\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.craigwarner.spinner_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"10127\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_ScreenIntro.png","screenshot":"10127\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_ScreenIntro.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"thumbnail":"10127\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_ScreenHand.png","screenshot":"10127\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_ScreenHand.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"10127\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_ScreenProvoke.png","screenshot":"10127\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_ScreenProvoke.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
