EZ Sketch allows you to quickly sketch something or jot notes without the hassle of a full blown editor. EZ Sketch includes 4 colors, black, blue, green and red, as well as an eraser tool. You can also quickly start over by hitting the trash can icon. UPDATE: Now when you take a screen shot, the tool bar automatically goes away and it switches to full screen.","version":"1.0.3","homeURL":"http:\/\/forums.precentral.net\/ctl-advance\/219142-ez-sketch.html","supportURL":"http:\/\/forums.precentral.net\/ctl-advance\/219142-ez-sketch.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2009 CTL Advance CSAT","licenseURL":"http:\/\/forums.precentral.net\/ctl-advance\/219142-ez-sketch.html","locale":null,"appSize":"69606","installSize":"69606","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"0.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.ctladvance.ezsketch_1.0.3_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"766\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ezsketch_2009-10-12_004216.png","screenshot":"766\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ezsketch_2009-10-12_004216.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"766\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ezsketch_2009-10-12_010935.png","screenshot":"766\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ezsketch_2009-10-12_010935.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
