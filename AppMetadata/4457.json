{"publicApplicationId":"com.13appdesign.beantown","description":"Must have app for any Boston sports fan. Up to the minute Boston sports news, from multiple sources, displayed through a single feed. Enjoy.\n\n**After a couple of initial missteps, a new version of Beantown sports has been baked-up. v1.1.3 is easier to read, displays full-screen and you can now choose individual feeds. \n\n**Beantown Sports was developed to provide its users a master feed page, which is a chronological mash-up of the top Boston sports news rss feeds. Unlike traditional rss readers the user does not have to click through countless news sources, one at a time. Instead they are given a master feed page, which contains hundreds of Boston sports news stories. \n\n**The feeds, in the master feed mash-up, were chosen because they are easy to read inside the application. Where feeds link to is outside the control of Beantown Sports. Links in an rss go to websites that are rendered by the Pre\u2019s web browser. \n\n**Currently the master feed page contains rss feeds from Boston Herald, ESPN Boston, CSNNE, Ch. 7 News and a Facebook mash-up. You can also choose to view feeds from Boston Globe, WEEI, and twitter on the individual feed list page. \n\n** Legal Notice - Beantown Sports has no affiliation with the news sources and websites that are broadcasting the rss feeds Beantown Sports is displaying.
