{"publicApplicationId":"com.appbookshop.theeinsteintheoryofrelativity","description":"Hendrik Antoon Lorentz was a Dutch physicist who shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics with Pieter Zeeman for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the Zeeman effect. He also derived the transformation equations subsequently used by Albert Einstein to describe space and time. The Einstein Theory of Relativity was a paper written by Professor Lorentz, in 1920, who is credited by Einstein with sharing the development of his theory. He is doubtless better able than any other man - except the author himself - to explain this scientific discovery.
