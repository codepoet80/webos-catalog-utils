{"publicApplicationId":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd","description":"**Update: 60% off regular price. \n\nNesEm is an award winning NES console system emulator. It recently won the Palm PDK Hot Apps award and won the best mobile game emulator awards by TechnoPalm and PDArcade in the past. You can play hundreds of NES games, also known as NES roms (not to be confused with SNES roms), with a single application. \n\nA full list of supported roms by NesEm can be found here:\n\nwww.kalemsoft.com\/site\/docs\/nes_list.txt\n\nNesEm comes with two sample NES games. More games can be obtained separately and added to the application. \n\nTo add roms, just connect your TouchPad to your PC via USB cable and select USB drive mode on your TouchPad when prompted. A new drive will appear on your computer. Open the drive by clicking its icon and navigate to KalemSoft\/nesem\/roms folder (when NesEm is run once, this folder will be created automatically). Then, copy your games with .nes or .zip file extension into this folder directly. Finally, right click the drive icon, select eject option to exit the USB drive mode and disconnect your TouchPad from your PC. NesEm will see the games you added next time it is run (sometimes a device restart may be needed for the file system to recognize the files newly added). \n\nNesEm has the following features. Support for various resolutions, portrait and landscape play mode, on screen gamepad, external keyboard support, GameGenie cheats, zipped rom support and state saving with screenshots. \n\n** NesEm was developed from scratch. Many hours were spent on building and testing it over 7 years. It is not based on any Open Source work. We charge for NesEm just to recover part of the effort put towards building and maintaining it for different devices over 7 years. **","version":"1.2.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.kalemsoft.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.kalemsoft.com\/support","custsupportemail":"support@kalemsoft.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2003-2011 KalemSoft","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":508266,"installSize":2293760,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-07-16T17:01:36.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_sctp1.png","thumbnail":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_sctp1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_sctp2.png","thumbnail":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_sctp2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_sctp3.png","thumbnail":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_sctp3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_sctp4.png","thumbnail":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_sctp4.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_sctp5.png","thumbnail":"com.kalemsoft.nesemhd\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_sctp5.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
