{"publicApplicationId":"com.shanerooni.soccershots","description":"Please read the instructions once you download the game.  The instructions and options will help you tailor the game to your liking.\n\nThis is a first for Palm's webOS (in my opinion).  We've all been waiting for a truly immersive sports game, and Soccer Shots delivers a game-winner!  You will take on the clock or the goalie - your choice - in order to try and amass the best shot percentage and time left\/blocks stats!  The levels get harder, but your skills should increase through the 80 levels of play.  \n\nIn 40 levels of Beat-the-Timer you race the clock, trying to score a number of goals before the timer runs out.  The same goals are required in Beat-the-Goalie's 40 levels, except you have to score all of the goals before you are blocked more than 3 times!  Try your best to beat your biggest competitor - yourself!\n\nYour feedback is appreciated in order to grow this into a world class game!","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.shanerooni.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.shanerooni.com","custsupportemail":"admin@shanerooni.com","custsupportphonenum":"484.654.2668","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Shanerooni, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":374384,"installSize":4609802,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T01:03:47.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.shanerooni.soccershots_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"580\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/soccershots_2010-31-03_191453.png","thumbnail":"580\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/soccershots_2010-31-03_191453.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"580\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/soccershots_2010-31-03_191500.png","thumbnail":"580\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/soccershots_2010-31-03_191500.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"580\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/soccershots_2010-31-03_191613.png","thumbnail":"580\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/soccershots_2010-31-03_191613.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
