{"publicApplicationId":"com.daveprochnow.noman","description":"Imagine entering a world completely different from our own. A world uninhabited by people, animals, and moving automobiles\u2014a world lacking in animation. This strange world exists right before our eyes, coexisting with our animated lives, yet we cannot see it. Our cameras can see this alternate world, though.\n\nA parallel universe, if you will, that thrives on minutes, rather than shutter speeds of one sixtieth of a second. Recorded with minutes long exposures, imagery from this other world is as alarming and disquieting as it is surreal and tranquil\u2014an alternate reality.\n\nThe No Man App contains a complete museum exhibition experience.  Flip through the folio plates and view places that you might have been to, but you have never, ever seen. Peer into a parallel world. Human eyes can't see what the camera lens has meticulously recorded in No Man.\n\nNo Man: A World Without Being \n\n- Coffee table sized digital folio\n- 45 photographic plates\n- Introductory essay\n- Flip forward and backward through pages\n- Supports Exhibition Mode\n- Made exclusively for TouchPad","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/dpwebos.posterous.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/dpwebos.posterous.com\/","custsupportemail":"dp.webOS@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2001 Dave Prochnow","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":3867446,"installSize":5308416,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T22:59:50.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":true,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":2,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.daveprochnow.noman_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9179\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_NoMan1.png","thumbnail":"9179\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_NoMan1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"9179\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_NoMan2.png","thumbnail":"9179\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_NoMan2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"9179\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_NoMan3.png","thumbnail":"9179\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_NoMan3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"9179\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_NoMan4.png","thumbnail":"9179\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_NoMan4.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"9179\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_NoMan5.png","thumbnail":"9179\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_NoMan5.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
