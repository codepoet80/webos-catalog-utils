{"publicApplicationId":"com.knowified.toys.lisp-addict","description":"lisp-addict allows you to evaluate lisp\/scheme-like code on your WebOS device.  We created a WebOS front-end for the same lisp as can be found at http:\/\/norstrulde.org\/ilge10\/\n\nThe application contains a tutorial to get you started in programming with this little lisp.\n\nAlso:  There's a remote execution mechanism, which allows you to send lisp-code from emacs to your phone, where it will be evaluated.  There's no mojo-specific functionality exported in this lisp yet, so it's fairly safe to run.  By standard it tries to connect to an inexistant address.
