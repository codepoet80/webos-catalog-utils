Have you captured \"special moments\" with your device's camera that shouldn't be seen by everyone? If so, 'Ncognito is for you!!!\n\nNow, for HP webOS and TouchPad, you can hide your personal files from prying eyes. 'Ncognito offers an extra level of security knowing that you, and only you can view certain files on your device. \n\nFeatures include: \n\n* Password protection \n* Hide various file types (pictures, video, audio, documents) \n* Easily add and remove any files you want hidden or unhidden \n\nTo add a file, simply select \"Add a file\", and select the file of your choice.
