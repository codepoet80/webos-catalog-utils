His story is now legend. In 1994, after reading \"The Ecology of Commerce\" by Paul Hawken, Ray Anderson felt a \"spear in the chest.\" The founder of Interface, Inc., a billion-dollar carpeting manufacturer, realized that his company was plundering the environment and he needed to steer it on a new course. Since then, Interface has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 82%, and the goal is to reach zero environmental footprint by 2020. Thoughtful and winning, \"Confessions of a Radical Industrialist\" shows how Anderson revolutionized his company, in the process bringing costs down, improving quality, making it one of \"Fortune's\" \"100 Best Companies to Work For\" and driving up profits.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"6923678","installSize":"6923678","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"25.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.confessionsofaradicalindustria-9781551993157-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9677\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9677\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9677\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9677\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9677\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9677\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
