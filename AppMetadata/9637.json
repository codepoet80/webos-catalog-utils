Drawing on his experience as a top expert in information security, Hunker sets out to answer this critical question in \"Creeping Failure\".  Hunker takes a close look at the \"creeping failures\" that have kept us in a state of cyber insecurity: how and why they happened, and most crucially, how they can be fixed. And he arrives at some stunning conclusions about the dramatic measures that we will need to accomplish this. This groundbreaking book is an essential first step toward understanding the World Wide Web in a larger context as we try to build a safer Internet \"city.\" But it also raises issues that are relevant far outside the online realm: for example, how can we work together to create not just new policy, but new kinds of policy? \"Creeping Failure\" calls for nothing less than a basic rethinking of the Internet - and of how we solve problems together.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"5630032","installSize":"5630032","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"18.27","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.creepingfailurehowwebrokethein-9781551993515-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9637\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9637\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9637\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9637\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9637\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9637\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
