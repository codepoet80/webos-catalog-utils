{"publicApplicationId":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app","description":"Florida Landlords and Property Managers, PROTECT yourself. SECURE your property NOW! Get your MOBILE copy of all the statutes your tenants, lawyers, and judges use to throw out your evictions. SAVE time, stress, and money. Put the law back on your side.\nPlease note that this version is for Florida Statutes only. The remaining 49 states are currently in development.\nYour mobile phone app wasn\u2019t created for or by lawyers (Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be FREE would it?). It was made for the personal use of a small network of landlords. We needed a handy reference of our state statutes. Something convenient that was always at hand if we had questions.\nLike, \nhow to handle paperwork \nrental application questions\neviction procedures, and \navoid the appearance of discrimination.\nAfter creating our app, we decided to share it with other landlords like yourself.\nDon\u2019t expose yourself to a potential lawsuit by making an innocent mistake.\nDid you know if you file an eviction using an address that isn\u2019t local you have to allow more time?\nRemember, the laws are constructed in favor of your tenants. Because of that, doesn\u2019t it make sense to arm yourself with the right information?\nYou might be saying to yourself, \u201cWhy should I take the time to install your app on my phone or pad?\u201d. OK, it\u2019s no \u201cAngry Birds\u201d, I\u2019ll give you that. It\u2019s not the popular game everyone\u2019s playing, or some other hot new app of the month. It won\u2019t entertain you. In fact, statutes are rather boring.\nHowever if you\u2019re looking to protect yourself, by making sure you\u2019re well informed on your rental business law, then this app is for you. Think of it as eating your vegetables. The taste may not be as appealing as the desert, or other junk food, but you know it\u2019s something you really need to survive.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.landlordtenantstatutes.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.landlordtenantstatutes.com","custsupportemail":"rentget@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"17544447655","copyright":"copyright 2012 RentRollcall","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":140000,"installSize":1081344,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-04-03T23:16:04.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_ss2.png","thumbnail":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_ss2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_ss3.png","thumbnail":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_ss3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_ss4.png","thumbnail":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_ss4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_ss5.png","thumbnail":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_ss5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_ss6.png","thumbnail":"com.landlordtenantstatutes.app\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_ss6.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
