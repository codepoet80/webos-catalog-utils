{"publicApplicationId":"com.appbookshop.batwing","description":"Written in 1921 by Arthur Henry Sarsfield Ward, known better under his pseudonym, Sax Rohmer, Bat Wing is the first book of the Paul Harley detective series, featuring voodoo, vampirism, and murder in central London. Excerpt from book: A faint, sibilant sound drew my glance upward, and there overhead a bat circled - circled - dipped - and flew off toward the distant woods. So still was the night that I could distinguish the babble of the little stream which ran down into the lake. Then, suddenly, came a loud flapping of wings. The swans had been awakened by the sound of the shot. Others had been awakened, too, for now distant voices became audible, and then a muffled scream from somewhere within Cray's Folly.
