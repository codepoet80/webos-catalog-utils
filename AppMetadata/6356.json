A lifesaving action. \n\nWhen an adult has a sudden cardiac arrest, his or her survival depends greatly on immediately getting CPR from someone nearby. Unfortunately, less than 1\/3 of those people who experience a cardiac arrest at home, work or in a public location get that help. Most bystanders are worried that they might do something wrong or make things worse. That's why the American Heart Association has simplified things. \n\nTwo steps to save a life. \n\nIf you see an adult suddenly collapse, you should perform Hands-Only CPR: \n\n1) Call 911. \n2) Push hard and fast in the center of the chest. \n\nThis application will teach you how to perform Hands-Only CPR through video instruction. \n\nThis application brought to you by the American Heart Association, the nation's oldest and largest voluntary health organization dedicated to building healthier lives, free of heart disease and stroke.
