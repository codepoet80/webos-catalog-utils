{"publicApplicationId":"com.rzsystems.capturesuite","description":"With this app you can send quickly and easily a memo to yourself. \nFeatures:\n- Capture text\n- Capture foto\n- Capture audio (min. webOS 2)\n- Just Type integration (min. webOS 2)\n\nBasically it enables you to capture your thoughts by entering text, taking a picture or recording your voice and send them over to your email inbox with just a few touches.\nThe app also supports \"just type\" which was introduced with webOS 2.0.\n\nIf you are familiar with GTD this is the perfect companion to assist you during the first phase of GTD, the capture and collect phase. Everything goes straight to your email inbox, where you then can process your input.\n\nIf you use the Evernote app this also might be a great time safer, since the Evernote webos app is a bit cumbersome to use if things have to go real fast. Just provide your \"secret\" Evernote email adress and your thoughts will go straight to your Evernote account.\n\nFoto capture does not work on the TouchPad, because the HP stock camera app does not work like on the Pre.\n\nIf you find bugs your comments & feedback is welcome.\n\nChangelog:\n1.3.3 - Bugfix Release\n- Fixed: Send mail code was broken by accident.\n1.3.2 - Maintenance Release: \n- Fixed: Cannot use email address with a length < 30 characters.\n- Fixed: While playing music, launching capture-suite stops playback. Should stop playback when starting audio cpature at the earliest.\n- Enhancement: Text caputer via \"Just Type\" directly opens prepared email card.\n- Enhancement: Focusing the text capture input filed, now selects the text to make it easier to overwrite.\n- Removed: Deactivate capture foto button, because the stock camera app does not support a correct sub-launch with propper return of taken foto.\n1.3.1: \n- Fixed: Attachment file name gets appended\n- Possible Fix: White camera screen on Veer\n1.3.0: \n- Added: Audio capture functionality (Only available on devices with webOS 2 or higher)","version":"1.3.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.rzsystems.de","supportURL":"http:\/\/webos.rzsystems.de","custsupportemail":"support@rzsystems.de","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright RZSystem Renz &amp; Ziegler GbR","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":113144,"installSize":1081344,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-10-04T20:28:43.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":true,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.rzsystems.capturesuite_1.3.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.rzsystems.capturesuite\/1.3.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_big1-1_3_0.png","thumbnail":"com.rzsystems.capturesuite\/1.3.3\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_big1-1_3_0.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.rzsystems.capturesuite\/1.3.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_big4.png","thumbnail":"com.rzsystems.capturesuite\/1.3.3\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_big4.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.rzsystems.capturesuite\/1.3.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_big2.png","thumbnail":"com.rzsystems.capturesuite\/1.3.3\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_big2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.rzsystems.capturesuite\/1.3.3\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_big3.png","thumbnail":"com.rzsystems.capturesuite\/1.3.3\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_big3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
