{"publicApplicationId":"com.diniplay.photoframe","description":"Do you like Digital Photo Frames?\n\nYour device has some native applications that will display photos as a Digital Photo Frame (DPF), but they are very limited.\n\nWith DPF you can display all your photos in a very convenient way; but if you like one of a set, you can browse the photos easily with just a touch on the screen. DPF will find your photos, camera and Facebook (FB not yet on webos2).\n\nWe are so excited about our new app that we can not wait to share it with you anymore.\n\nDownload it while it is in promotion price (it will be more expensive later!), and you will get new updates with the upcoming options, as Flickr, Albums management (1st version yet working!) and everything you can think!\n\nEasy start! Just launch and your photos will be displayed with fade, pan and movement; a date&time clock, random order, device tilt, navigate with finger touch\u2026 and exhibition compatible.\n\nWith the option menu you can change display time, order, clock&date format... and many more options.\n\nUse the Photo Manager menu to select your photo's folder. That's all.\n\nUpcoming: FlickR and Picassa, pinch for Zoom, music, weather, albums\u2026\n\nPlease, copy your photos as separate folders inside \/photos folder so they will be used as albums in next versions. So, you should have a directory structure like this on your device:\n\n\/photos\n   \/Christmas 2010\/\n      001.jpg\n      ...\n   \/Summer 2011\n      anyname.jpg\n      morephotos.jpg\n\nIdeas?
