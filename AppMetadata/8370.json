{"publicApplicationId":"com.knowified.tasks","description":"HP made some bold moves, so we're chipping in!  We couldn't divide the price of the app by ten, but this is the lowest price we can ask in the app catalog.  Enjoy!\n\nThis application has been reviewed by P|C at http:\/\/www.precentral.net\/app-review-gtd-tasks-hand .  Most requests have been answered.\n\ntasks@hand makes you more productive by shifting your attention from what you need to do, to what you are doing.  This nifty task tracker will get you back into control of what you need to get done.  tasks@hand helps you in following David Allen's much praised Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology.\n\nIn order to keep your life organized, we keep track of tasks based on what you need in order to accomplish the task (contexts), on your intentions of doing the task (states), on the people that connect to it (contacts) and on possible deadlines.  You can easily outline a project by creating subtasks of arbitrary depth, each with arbitrary contexts, state, or contacts attached to them.  You can use it both to manage your projects as to manage your todo list.\n\nAmong the most important features:\n-QuickView showing you what you should do now\n-Unlimited amount of contexts\n-Weekly and monthly review\n-Backup through email\n-Attach any and as many Synergy contacts as you want to a task\n-Show contacts you need to talk to\n-Attach files to tasks\n-Various ways of viewing deadlines\n-Inbox to show incompletely defined tasks\n-Reorder almost any list with tasks or contexts\n-Global order of tasks automatically enables the next action for a project\n-Built for power users\n\nGet back in control.  Streamline your life & use tasks@hand to help you with that.\n\nTO USERS (1): If you have a feature request, use the precentral forum (preferred) or the mail option as found in the Help menu.
