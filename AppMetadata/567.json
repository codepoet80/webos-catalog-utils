{"publicApplicationId":"com.wog.osk","description":"Introducing \"Slide to Type\" technology to the ONLY osk that can interact directly with your other applications! Simply slide over a key to type it! Enhanced editing capabilities with a new edit window. You can move the cursor with the arrow keys, backspace, insert letters, anything you like. Once you send it to the application, though, you cannot edit it anymore. Landscape keyboard shows when in the browser! The landscape keyboard is slide to type only because a tap may hit a link in the browser behind the OSK. This OSK is also an Application in and of itself with App Mode (function then rocket key). See the help for a complete description, but you can look up words, save text to your clipboard, add quick keys, map locations, and much more! With the 57 programmable quick keys, you can save time typing by programming usernames, passwords, usual text replies, or anything you like. When you need to retrieve it, press the qk key on the OSK and choose the number you programmed it in to. You can also slide over the key to have a preview of what you programmed in. If you're fast with the slide to type, please post a video on youtube! Also, please update your reviews and don't forget to use the contact form on the website to email me!","version":"1.0.7","versionNote":"Slide to Type technology\nBubble letters\nLandscape keyboard in Browser\nEditing window\nQuick Keys preview","homeURL":"http:\/\/webosgroup.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/osk.webosgroup.com","custsupportemail":"support@webosgroup.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2009 WebOS Group","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":224140,"installSize":2949120,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T09:50:10.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fbuaAzsSPcs","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/fbuaAzsSPcs\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":2.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.wog.osk_1.0.7_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"567\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/1\/L\/messaging_2010-20-10_162024.png","thumbnail":"567\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/1\/L\/messaging_2010-20-10_162024.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"567\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/2\/L\/browser_2010-20-10_162210.png","thumbnail":"567\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/2\/L\/browser_2010-20-10_162210.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"567\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/3\/L\/osk_2010-20-10_162339.png","thumbnail":"567\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/3\/L\/osk_2010-20-10_162339.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"567\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/4\/L\/osk_2010-20-10_162317.png","thumbnail":"567\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/4\/L\/osk_2010-20-10_162317.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"567\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/5\/L\/email_2010-20-10_162434.png","thumbnail":"567\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/5\/L\/email_2010-20-10_162434.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
