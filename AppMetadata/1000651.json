{"publicApplicationId":"com.davidjarvismd.equisteroidia","description":"EquiSteroidia joins EquiAnalgesia as a steroid medical calculator for physicians to use when converting from one IV or oral steroid to another.  You pick the first steroid from a list, the dose of that steroid, and then click on the calculate button, and the conversion dose is displayed.  No bells or whistles, except the background chemical skeleton of cortisone beats the boring Android medical calculator black screens in webOS style!\n\nOn the Touchpad, it runs right side up.  I don't know how to make it do that in the emulator for screen shots though. \n\nI based this on EquiAnalgesia, my narcotic conversion calculator app.  Both are free in the App Catalog.  In the future, when HP's newer developer interface comes out, I may combine them into one app, along with an ABG app perhaps. \n\nThe app is free, but if you like it enough, there is a link to donate to my PayPal account and make my wife feel like this is a better use of my time than her list for me!\n\nMy background: I am a family doctor in Wisconsin, USA, and I make medical apps for webOS phones because I prefer my Verizon Pre3 over every other phone I have had, and I hate using my Android phone more than I absolutely must for Epocrates and Lexicomp!","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/bboodoc.blogspot.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/bboodoc.blogspot.com\/","custsupportemail":"djarvis86@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 David Jarvis","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":58986,"installSize":1277952,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-03-05T06:43:10.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.davidjarvismd.equisteroidia_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.davidjarvismd.equisteroidia\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_equisteroidiatabcap1.jpg","thumbnail":"com.davidjarvismd.equisteroidia\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_equisteroidiatabcap1.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.davidjarvismd.equisteroidia\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_equisteroidiatabcap3.jpg","thumbnail":"com.davidjarvismd.equisteroidia\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_equisteroidiatabcap3.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.davidjarvismd.equisteroidia\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_equisteroidiatabcap2.jpg","thumbnail":"com.davidjarvismd.equisteroidia\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_equisteroidiatabcap2.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
