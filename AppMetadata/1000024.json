Anyone who has ever submitted to a battery of medical tests will empathize with Dr. Seuss\u2019s Everyman as we follow him through his checkup with the experts at the Golden Years Clinic. From the initial Eyesight and Solvency Test through all the stops along Stethoscope Row to finally being \u201cproperly pilled\u201d and \u201cproperly billed,\u201d Dr. Seuss lightens the aches and pains of growing old with his inimitable wit and wisdom.\n\n\"You're Only Old Once!\" was written shortly after Geisel had suffered through a series of illnesses, during which he spent a considerable amount of time in hospital waiting rooms. To pass the time, he began sketching images of hospital machines and scenes of medical procedures. \n\nNew features only available in this omBook include professional narration, background audio and digital artwork for each scene. \u00a0To promote reading in young children, individual words are highlighted as the story is read and words zoom up when pictures are touched. \u00a0By combining the original text and artwork of Dr. Seuss with features that entertain and promote reading, this omBook appeals to readers of all ages.\n\nThree ways to read this omBook:\n? \"Read to Me\" \u2014 listen to the narrated story with words highlighted as they are read\n? \"Read it Myself\" \u2014 read the book in its traditional form\n? \"Auto Play\" \u2014 plays like a movie, automatically reading and turning pages. Great for younger children!\n\nAdditional Features:\n? Picture \/ Word association \u2014 words zoom up and are spoken when pictures are touched\n? Professional audio narration\n?
