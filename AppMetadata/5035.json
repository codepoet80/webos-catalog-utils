{"publicApplicationId":"com.clearwater.trial.babycare","description":"Fully functional one week trial.\n\nEasily track, review, and make notes on your baby's feedings, naps, and diapers. \n\nUse the customized timer to track your breast feeding time on both the left and right sides or manually enter the time after feeding. Log bottle feedings by the ounce or mL, solid food by the ounce, and optionally add notes to any feeding. \n\nWet and soiled diapers can be logged individually, so you can make sure your baby's body is working correctly. \n\nAll events are saved to the history, so you can easily access them at the pediatrician or just to examize your baby's habits. All the data can also be exported via email from the History screen.\n\nChoose between the baby boy, girl, or gray theme. \n\nThis app is for new parents, by a new parent. Within a week of bringing our new baby home, I began developing this app to track feedings and diapers, after having to log the first week on the paper the hospital sent us home with. Now we use our app!\n\nIf you have questions about Baby Care, please follow the link to our website & free to leave any feature requests in your review.
