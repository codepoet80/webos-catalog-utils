There\u2019s Arthur, her childhood sweetheart; then, there\u2019s the enigmatic, charming Judge Wade; and of course, there\u2019s her cousin Tom; and then, her infuriating neighbor, John Moore\u2026 But who will melt her heart?\n\n    It is Arthur\u2019s return, and his seemingly simple request of wanting to see her in the same blue dress she wore when he left, that throws everything into turmoil\u2026\n\n    Sometimes, one can only find some solace in one\u2019s garden.\n\n    Narrated in a refreshingly modern and playful style by none other than Molly herself, this book is the British magazine version; there\u2019s a significantly different American novel version. (Summary by Elli, Julie VW and Stav Nisser) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
