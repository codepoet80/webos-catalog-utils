{"publicApplicationId":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free","description":"With ReadOnTouch FREE you can test the most comfortable and newest ReadItLater-Client for WebOS. You can test the complete navigation, the layout and the base functionality.\n\nWhich one of us is not familiar with this situation: You've found some really interesting web pages, but you have actually no time to read them... That is history with this app! With ReadOnTouch FREE you can easily access stored web pages in an incredibly comfortable way. With ReadOnTouch FREE, you can both read articles and easily add new web pages to your reading list. \n\nReadOnTouch PRO can do much more:\n* It allows you to select the number of articles to be downloaded.\n* It allows you to limit synchronization to unread articles.\n* It allows you to read articles everywhere, if you synced your reading list before leaving the house.\n* New articles can be added with a patched standard browser and with the Advanced Browser (1.2.6+)!\n* Articles can be opened in the Advanced Browser (TP only).\n* The article list fills the left panel; there are no banners or popups.\n\nChanges in this version only affect webOS 2.1 devices:\n- Bugfix: links inside articles can't hit anymore accidently\n- Bugfix: on the HP Veer the banner has been removed from the article-list\n- Bugfix: toolbars are now shown properly\n\nAttention: WebOS 2.1 devices require the latest update of the Maps app by HP, to be able to run ReadOnTouch FREE. Due the new enyo-framework on that devices, the app can be slow and laggy. Just test before you buy!","version":"1.0.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/sven-ziegler.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/sven-ziegler.com","custsupportemail":"readontouch@sven-ziegler.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Sven Ziegler","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":303982,"installSize":2424832,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-11-21T19:54:52.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free_1.0.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_1.png","thumbnail":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_2.png","thumbnail":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_3.png","thumbnail":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_4.png","thumbnail":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_4.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_5.png","thumbnail":"com.sven-ziegler.readontouch-free\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_5.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
