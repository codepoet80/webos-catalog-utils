{"publicApplicationId":"com.jackpot.jackerlite","description":"***webOS 2.x and VEER compatible! NOT PIXI Compatible. J@cker Lite is a simple and extremely addicting game. Very similar to the Stacker arcade game (Not exactly like it... with J@cker Lite you get one chance to stack to the top!!!). Takes three seconds to learn how to play, but will entertain you for much, much longer! After you've mastered this free version, try the 99 cent paid version for even more challenging game play. Press \"j\" to start the game, press the space button (space bar), to stop the blocks from moving side to side. Stack the left hand column of blocks evenly as high as you can!","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/jackpotideas.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/jackpotideas.com","custsupportemail":"support@jackpotideas.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 J@ckpot ideas Inc.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":567790,"installSize":1212416,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-04-12T23:22:16.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.jackpot.jackerlite_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.jackpot.jackerlite\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/320x480_320x480_JackerLite.png","thumbnail":"com.jackpot.jackerlite\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/320x480_75x112_JackerLite.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.jackpot.jackerlite\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/320x480_320x480_JackerMenu.png","thumbnail":"com.jackpot.jackerlite\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/320x480_75x112_JackerMenu.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
