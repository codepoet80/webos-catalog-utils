{"publicApplicationId":"com.palmdts.allman.dragstatsgps","description":"**Added option for audible countdown** NOW WITH HORSEPOWER**  You asked for it and you got it.  Drag Stats now calculates horsepower and audibly countsdown!  (Update:  Added option to email timeslip information.)  Drag Stats uses the GPS and the accelerometer of WebOS to calculate and display key statistics for performance vehicles.  Simply position your phone, in any orientation, in your vehicle and press the start button.  When the countdown gets to green you are off.  Drag Stats will display data for 0-60mph time, 1\/8th mile time, 1\/4th mile time, horsepower, speed, distance traveled, average speed, and max g-force attained.   MPH not your thing?  Drag Stats allows you to choose KMPH instead.  Test your vehicles performance with Drag Stats today.\n\nPlease be sure to see the help menu for an explanation of how different values are calculated and how to obtain the utmost accuracy from your runs.\n\nUpdate:  Due to request I have added horsepower calculations from 1\/4 mile times. Also added a few other minor fixes.\n\n**Drag Stats is intended for use in a safe manner.  Please use at a track designed for this sort of use.
