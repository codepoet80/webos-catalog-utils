The narrator, a reprehensible and seedy journalist, sets out to interview a minor author, and in his own quest for glory, turns the author into the celebrity of the day. The sudden and untimely death of the author, with his latest work unfinished, presents a troubling dilemma for the narrator, which he resolves with no more conscience than he had when he began his quest. (Introduction by Christine Dufour) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"290982","installSize":"290982","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.2","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.thedeathofthelionaudio_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7201\/images\/1\/L\/thedeathofthelion1.png","screenshot":"7201\/images\/1\/L\/thedeathofthelion1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7201\/images\/2\/L\/thedeathofthelion2.png","screenshot":"7201\/images\/2\/L\/thedeathofthelion2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
