{"publicApplicationId":"info.opensourcejason.glissito","description":"Glissito is a trial version of Gliss, a simple puzzle\/strategy game. This version contains 4 of the 20 levels. The game consists of colored blocks that are progressively placed on a square grid. You can move the blocks into another square on the grid if it's possible for them to glide there my moving only horizontally and\/or vertically across adjacent spaces. After a certain number of blocks drop, the level increases. As the levels increase, the board becomes more restrictive, more blocks fall per level, and more colors appear. There are 4 levels in this demo version, and the game is over once no more moves can be made on a given level, or you complete both levels.","version":"1.6.6","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/opensourcejason.info\/MobileApps","supportURL":"http:\/\/opensourcejason.info\/MobileApps","custsupportemail":"gliss@opensourcejason.info","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2009 Emerjbl","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":69672,"installSize":2372538,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-05-11T00:17:19.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"info.opensourcejason.glissito_1.6.6_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"1033\/en\/images\/1\/S\/gliss_2010-02-05_200256.png","screenshot":"1033\/en\/images\/1\/L\/gliss_2010-02-05_200256.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"1033\/en\/images\/2\/S\/glissito_2009-28-12_192113.png","screenshot":"1033\/en\/images\/2\/L\/glissito_2009-28-12_192113.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"1033\/en\/images\/3\/S\/gliss_2010-02-05_200411.png","screenshot":"1033\/en\/images\/3\/L\/gliss_2010-02-05_200411.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
