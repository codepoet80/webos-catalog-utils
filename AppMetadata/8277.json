By and large, the work is a triumphant exercise in philosophical poetry, communicating its broad and commonplace truths in superbly balanced phrases which remind us that Pope, alas, is one of the most quoted but least read writers in English:\n\n    \u201cHope springs eternal in the human breast: Man never is, but always To be Blest.\u201d\n\n    (Summary by Martin Geeson)\n\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
