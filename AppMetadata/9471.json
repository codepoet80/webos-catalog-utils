{"publicApplicationId":"com.thinmartian.guardian.zeitgeist","description":"The Guardian newspaper, and guardian.co.uk, are ecognised for their original international news reporting and powerful investigative journalism, offering a global, liberal perspective on politics, culture and the environment.\n\nThe Guardian Zeitgeist app presents an alternative view of guardian.co.uk content, influenced by what users are finding interesting and not purely by what editors and journalists are finding interesting. It is not a curated collection of content, but an array of different things that have received a lot of attention. As a result, content on the app is often diverse and far-reaching. For example, a hard-hitting news story could easily sit between a quirky picture gallery and a football live blog. \n\nThe combination of content changes throughout the day, sometimes by the minute, as users' activity shifts around the site, stories get linked to or talked about via social media, new content is published and widely read, and so on.\n\nThe app has the following features:\n- the latest zeitgeist content viewable for the whole site or organised by section\n- article pages featuring links to related content\n- gallery and cartoon pages\n- option to share via email, Facebook and Twitter\n- swipe navigation between articles","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/mobile","custsupportemail":"userhelp@guardian.co.uk","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"\u00a9 Guardian News and Media Limited","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1657902,"installSize":32931840,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-06-29T09:17:49.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.thinmartian.guardian.zeitgeist_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"9471\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_Homepage.jpg","screenshot":"9471\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_Homepage.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"9471\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_Article.jpg","screenshot":"9471\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_Article.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"9471\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_Article-dupe.jpg","screenshot":"9471\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_Article-dupe.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
