{"publicApplicationId":"com.northlightgames.hippoquest","description":"*Hippo Quest Update: new Levelpack and support for the Pre 2*\n\nHippoQuest is a rather cute looking physics puzzler developed by game design students from the second semester. It is a work in progress and we will be happy about any feedback we can get. We will improve the game with regular updates.\nYou can test Hippo Quest for free at: http:\/\/northlight-games.com\/hippo-quest\n\nPlease leave comments and feedback on our homepage. If you like what we did consider pressing the like button on our Facebook Page. \n\nThe Game:\nYour goal is to hit one alien each Level. Some are easy targets, others hide behind obstacles and will require some thinking. The less bullets you use the higher your score will be. Also if the blue bullet hits the alien first, it will give some nice bonus points.\n\nThis release of Hippo Quest comes with 40 different Levels. At least 60 more level will come with regular updates. Global Highscores available!","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/northlight-games.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/northlight-games.com\/hippo-quest","custsupportemail":"mail@northlight-games.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Northlight Games","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":20238384,"installSize":28114944,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T09:06:46.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.northlightgames.hippoquest_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.northlightgames.hippoquest\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_0.png","thumbnail":"com.northlightgames.hippoquest\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_0.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.northlightgames.hippoquest\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_1.png","thumbnail":"com.northlightgames.hippoquest\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.northlightgames.hippoquest\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_2.png","thumbnail":"com.northlightgames.hippoquest\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.northlightgames.hippoquest\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_3.png","thumbnail":"com.northlightgames.hippoquest\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
