{"publicApplicationId":"com.digikat.digiobd","description":"Do you have a vehicle?  Is the check engine light on or do you need to do some performance tuning?   \n\nDigiOBDII is a diagnostics software to connect to your vehicle\u2019s on board OBD-II compliant computer (ECU) to read trouble codes and sensor data. DigiOBDII currently supports 60 sensors you can monitor in real-time. These sensors are based on SAE J1979 which is mainly related to emissions.  Although this is considered a standard, your vehicle manufacturer is not required to implement them thus not all the sensors may work on your vehicle.\n\nMetric and US Standard units are supported.  The database contains most of the standard trouble codes with their description.\n\nDigiOBDII has been tested with OBDLink Bluetooth scan tools on WebOS 2.1. See the ScanTool.net LLC website for their product information.  This application is compatible with ELM327.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.digikatsoftware.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.digikatsoftware.com\/html\/digiobdii1.html","custsupportemail":"support@digikatsoftware.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 DigiKat Software Company","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":122490,"installSize":2981888,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T22:03:22.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":19.95,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.digikat.digiobd_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9003\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/obd1.PNG","thumbnail":"9003\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/obd1.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"9003\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/obd2.PNG","thumbnail":"9003\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/obd2.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"9003\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/obd3.PNG","thumbnail":"9003\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/obd3.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"9003\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/obd4.PNG","thumbnail":"9003\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/obd4.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"9003\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/obd6.PNG","thumbnail":"9003\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/obd6.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
