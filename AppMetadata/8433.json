{"publicApplicationId":"gworley3.yi-jing","description":"The Book of Changes (\u6613\u7ecf, Y\u00ec J\u012bng, I Ching) is an ancient Chinese oracle for learning about the universe. You focus hard on your question, writing it down if that helps you see it clearly, and then the oracle responds as you perform a divination to produce two symbols, each of six lines, each line either yang or yin, young or old. You must then try to understand what the oracle has told you by interpreting its meaning in response to your question.\n\nThis app brings the Y\u00ec J\u012bng to webOS. It offers three divination methods (yarrow stalk, three coins, and uniform) and provides some basic information to help you interpret the oracle's response.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/gworley3.blogspot.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/webos-yi-jing","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Gordon Worley","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":51404,"installSize":851968,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T19:43:53.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"gworley3.yi-jing_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"8433\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot1.png","thumbnail":"8433\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"8433\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.png","thumbnail":"8433\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
