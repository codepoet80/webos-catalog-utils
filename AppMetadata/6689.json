{"publicApplicationId":"com.knoopnet.finmathpro","description":"Do you have questions concerning loans, savings & deposits? According to the equation\nCo * q ** n = Cn\nthis app calculates one value of a deposit, saving and\/or loan separately. If you're interested in this app you may first try the free version 'FinaMath08' which has no credit or monthly options.\nBefore tapping the '=?'-button the value wanted has to be set to 0. Additionally you have options for montly\/yearly and regular payment in arrear\/advance.\nRemember that even for monthly payments the annual interest is displayed! In those cases the monthly interest factor is displayed under 'ps:'.\nThe calculation of the interest for the savings or creditrates is only possible by iteration. In case of high interests and\/or lots of periods the iteration will be cut to avoid endless loops. Though the resulting closing capital\/amount is displayed additionally behind the value for q.\nEach calculation may also be sent via email by option.","version":"1.0.6","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.knoopnet.de\/apps\/index.html","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.knoopnet.de\/apps\/fiMaP.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 by knoopnet.de","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":54614,"installSize":819200,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T12:23:54.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.knoopnet.finmathpro_1.0.6_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"6689\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/L\/finmathpro_2010-17-12_130615.png","thumbnail":"6689\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/L\/finmathpro_2010-17-12_130615.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"6689\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/L\/finmathpro_2010-17-12_125906.png","thumbnail":"6689\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/L\/finmathpro_2010-17-12_125906.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"6689\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/L\/finmathpro_2010-17-12_130044.png","thumbnail":"6689\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/L\/finmathpro_2010-17-12_130044.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"6689\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/4\/L\/finmathpro_2010-17-12_130000.png","thumbnail":"6689\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/4\/L\/finmathpro_2010-17-12_130000.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"6689\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/5\/L\/finmathpro_2010-17-12_130555.png","thumbnail":"6689\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/5\/L\/finmathpro_2010-17-12_130555.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
