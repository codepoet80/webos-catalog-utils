{"publicApplicationId":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle","description":"Peg Puzzle: Shapes is a digital take on the classic children\u2019s wooden peg puzzle toys. A fun and interactive way of learning, the game helps to develop fine motor skills, hand eye coordination, logical thinking skills and can also be used as a tool to help develop vocabulary through object recognition.\n\nIt is believed that shape recognition and matching skills play an important role in mathematical development. Matching is also an important skill for young children to develop because it is an essential pre-reading skill.\n\nThe object of the game is simple, match the correct shape to the correct space. Each time a right answer is achieved the player is rewarded by a visual and audio response and when all six spaces have been correctly filled the player receives a round of applause. This helps to build a sense of achievement which the child will wish to repeat again and again. The app is designed specifically for young children and has been tested by a range of 2 \u2013 4 year olds. \n\nEach time a game is loaded six random shapes are selected and laid out on the board; each shape has six possible answers. This gives thousands of possible combinations giving hours of fun. The game is currently split into eight categories and a random mode.\n\nFruit\nApples, apricot, banana, cherries, grapes, lemon, melon, orange, pear, plum & more\nTransport\nAeroplanes, bike, boats, cars, helicopter, lorry, van, train & more\nMusic\nDrum, guitars, keyboard, microphone, piano, trumpet, violin & more\nProduce\nAsparagus, beetroot, carrot, chillis, corn, garlic, mushroom, onion, pepper, pumpkin, tomato & more\nOut at sea\nAnchor, crab, diver, dolphin, lobster, octopus, prawns, seahorse, shells, squid, starfish & more\nGarden\nBeetle, bee, butterfly, caterpillar, flowers, grasshopper, ladybird, spider, tools & more\nBuilding Site:\nA range of construction vehicles & tools\nWeather\nSun, rain, wind, snow, lightning, rainbow & more\nRandom\nRandom shapes selected from any of the eight available categories","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"Two new puzzle categories added: 'Building Site' and 'Weather'\nAlso added a random mode where shapes are selected from any of the eight available categories","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.pulseapps.co.uk","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.pulseapps.co.uk","custsupportemail":"info@pulseapps.co.uk","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 Pulse Apps","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":17017478,"installSize":35618816,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2013-05-04T00:11:04.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_screenshot1.jpg","thumbnail":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_screenshot1.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_screenshot2.jpg","thumbnail":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_screenshot2.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_screenshot3.jpg","thumbnail":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_screenshot3.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_screenshot4.jpg","thumbnail":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_screenshot4.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_screenshot5.jpg","thumbnail":"com.pulse.pegpuzzle\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/5\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_screenshot5.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
