{"publicApplicationId":"com.orstudios.drinkingtrivia","description":"**New for 1.1.0 - Added over 75 new questions** Drinking Trivia is a fun drinking game to play with a group of friends, which based around random trivia questions. The game includes over 500 questions!  One person reads out a question and everyone in the group answers. All the questions have either number answers or something else that is easy to guess, like days of the week. This is done so everyone can guess, even if they have no idea what the answer is. Once everyone has given their answer, the person with the phone checks what the answer is. The person who guessed closest wins and and can give out one drink. If the answer is a range of answers, anyone within the range wins. Also the person with the answer which was farthest from the correct answer has to drink. If you are playing in a large group, you can also have the top 2 or three people give a drink and the bottom 2 or 3 people have to drink.  ***There are two ways to access the questions. You can use the random mode or you can use the list mode. You can select which categories you want to include in the random mode. In the list mode you will be able to look through all the categories and questions that are in the program.","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/orstudios.blogspot.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/orstudios.blogspot.com\/","custsupportemail":"orstudios@gmx.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":77784,"installSize":2606173,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-03-10T08:03:25.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.orstudios.drinkingtrivia_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"1522\/en\/images\/1\/S\/drinkingtrivia_2010-27-01_180756.png","screenshot":"1522\/en\/images\/1\/L\/drinkingtrivia_2010-27-01_180756.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"1522\/en\/images\/2\/S\/drinkingtrivia_2010-27-01_180856.png","screenshot":"1522\/en\/images\/2\/L\/drinkingtrivia_2010-27-01_180856.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"1522\/en\/images\/3\/S\/drinkingtrivia_2010-28-01_151443.png","screenshot":"1522\/en\/images\/3\/L\/drinkingtrivia_2010-28-01_151443.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
