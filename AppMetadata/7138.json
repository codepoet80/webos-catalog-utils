These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\n    The Passionate Pilgrim was published by William Jaggard, later the publisher of Shakespeare\u2019s First Folio. The first edition survives only in a single fragmentary copy; its date cannot be fixed with certainty since its title page is missing, though many scholars judge it likely to be from 1599, the year the second edition appeared with the attribution to Shakespeare.\n\n    This version of The Passionate Pilgrim, contains 15 romantic sonnets and short poems. The works contained, while disputed as to authorship are in this writer\u2019s most humble opinion, among the best of the age.
