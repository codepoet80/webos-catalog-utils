{"publicApplicationId":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre","description":"ATTENTION USERS: Google is discontinuing use of the Voice(tm) service by third party applications on or after May 15, 2014.  This app will cease to function at some point after that date.  If Google provides a public API to the Voice services after that point, this app will be updated to use that new API, but it is not clear at this time if that will happen.\n\nHarness the power of the Google Voice service to send and receive SMS text messages, forward incoming and outgoing telephone calls to any telephone, control your Google Calendar, check your voicemail, and more: \n\n- Forward calls through your Google Voice number \n- Send and receive SMS text messages from your Google Voice number - including support for long messages exceeding 160 characters! \n- Listen to voicemails right on your phone or tablet (webOS 2.0+ required)\n- Text-to-Speech for incoming text messages (webOS 2.2+ required) \n- Archive messages, mark as read or starred, block callers, delete conversations \n- Search past text conversations \n- Do-not-Disturb mode to force all calls to voicemail \n- Automatic new message checking with pop-up notifications \n\n Google Voice does NOT provide VOIP services - you can NOT make phone calls using with this app alone. \n\nAll Google Voice requirements apply- phone calls require an existing telephone device or Google Voice enabled device, such as Google Talk with Voice. \n\nIf you do not have a Google Voice account, you must be in the U.S. to set it up. \n\nFurther information and sign up can be found at the Google Voice site at http:\/\/voice.google.com\/ and at the GVoice site at http:\/\/ericbla.de\/gvoice-webos \n\nThis application requires the latest system update, installed with the HP Maps application available in your App Catalog.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"Bringing up to parity with GVoice 1.0.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.ericbla.de\/gvoice-webos","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.ericbla.de\/gvoice-webos","custsupportemail":"blade.eric@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"9519993267","copyright":"Copyright 2011-2012 Eric Blade","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":207938,"installSize":3276800,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2014-04-19T00:26:39.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IbGxB47s9gQ","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/IbGxB47s9gQ\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":true,"connectors":["null"],"services":["connector\/CONTACTS","connector\/MESSAGING"],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_pre-overview.png","thumbnail":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_pre-overview.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_pre-index.png","thumbnail":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_pre-index.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_pre-compose.png","thumbnail":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_pre-compose.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_pre-prefs.png","thumbnail":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_pre-prefs.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_pre-voicemail.png","thumbnail":"com.ericblade.gvoicepre\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_pre-voicemail.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
