{"publicApplicationId":"com.diceapps.webos.stoptimer","description":"Update: The StopTimer now has an on screen number pad for easier countdown input. StopTimer is a full featured stopwatch and timer application for webOS. It includes the expected functionality such as pause, resume, clear and advanced interval-splitting (to display both the lap and cumulative time of the split). It supports landscape mode that provides a larger time display. You can set your own ringer (including songs from your music library) and turn on\/off vibrate for the countdown alert. Plus, it includes preference settings for how often you want banner notifications to be displayed when running in the background. For full customization, you can change the color theme, and for ease of use you can set tapping the clock to handle pause\/resume or split. You can even export or copy your lap (split) times for later reference.","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/diceapps.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/diceapps.com\/contact.php","custsupportemail":"support@diceapps.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 DiceApps","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":464860,"installSize":2326528,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-10-12T14:57:54.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fsqaGZFJfng","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/fsqaGZFJfng\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.diceapps.webos.stoptimer_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"899\/en\/images\/1\/S\/shot01.png","screenshot":"899\/en\/images\/1\/L\/shot01.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"899\/en\/images\/2\/S\/shot02.png","screenshot":"899\/en\/images\/2\/L\/shot02.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"899\/en\/images\/3\/S\/shot03.png","screenshot":"899\/en\/images\/3\/L\/shot03.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"899\/en\/images\/4\/S\/shot04.png","screenshot":"899\/en\/images\/4\/L\/shot04.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"899\/en\/images\/5\/S\/shot05.png","screenshot":"899\/en\/images\/5\/L\/shot05.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
