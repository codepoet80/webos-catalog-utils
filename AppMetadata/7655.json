{"publicApplicationId":"com.prenewbie.grouponforwebos","description":"########## V 1.0.1 - Minor bug fixes and another screen to select city if gps data is not available.\n##########\n##########Please note - This app is designed for webOS 1.4.5 by default. This app will not work well with webOS 2.0+. However, it works well with webOS 2.1. ########## \n                                                             \nIf the phone is not able to get the current gps coordinates, it defaults to St. Johns. To fix, this here is what you need to do one time.\n\n1) Open the app. If you are still getting St.Johns, please do steps 2 and 3.( If you are getting deals for your city, go to step 4 directly.)\n2) Click on St. Johns and you will see a list of cities.\n3) Select your city from the list.\n4) Once you see deals for your city, add that city to favorites by clicking on the Star () on top left corner. Star's color should change to golden.\n5) Now you are all set!\n6) Next time you login, it will pull the deals for the city you just added as favorite.\n                                            \n############ This is an app for Groupon.com. It uses api provided by Groupon.com. It has cool features like sharing a deal via email\/text, mapping redeemable locations etc. To browse through the deals, just swipe the deal image to either directions.\n   \n\nYou can enter your preferences like email id and referral id. When you save your email id, the app will pull deals customized for you by groupon.com. If you enter your referral id, it will use that referral id while sharing the deal information with your friends. Thus, you can earn groupon bucks (if the person is new to groupon and makes his\/her first purchase using the link you sent).  \n  \n   \n   \n***********\nPlease Note : When you click on buy, you directly go to Groupon.com's mobile website to complete the purchase. This app does not have in-app purchase feature. \n***********  \n  \n######### \n\nPlease click on help and send me feedback so that I can make changes to the app.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/webosappsforyou.blogspot.com","supportURL":"https:\/\/spreadsheets.google.com\/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dEozR055T1hidEh5QTRHaHZldFhLbXc6MQ#gid=0","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":112200,"installSize":1572864,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-03-28T22:24:50.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MeMQELbFwn4","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/MeMQELbFwn4\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.prenewbie.grouponforwebos_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"7655\/en\/images\/1\/S\/grouponforwebos_2011-15-02_213234.png","screenshot":"7655\/en\/images\/1\/L\/grouponforwebos_2011-15-02_213234.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"7655\/en\/images\/2\/S\/grouponforwebos_2011-15-02_213242.png","screenshot":"7655\/en\/images\/2\/L\/grouponforwebos_2011-15-02_213242.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"7655\/en\/images\/3\/S\/grouponforwebos_2011-15-02_213246.png","screenshot":"7655\/en\/images\/3\/L\/grouponforwebos_2011-15-02_213246.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"7655\/en\/images\/4\/S\/grouponforwebos_2011-15-02_213254.png","screenshot":"7655\/en\/images\/4\/L\/grouponforwebos_2011-15-02_213254.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"7655\/en\/images\/5\/S\/grouponforwebos_2011-15-02_213339.png","screenshot":"7655\/en\/images\/5\/L\/grouponforwebos_2011-15-02_213339.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
