{"publicApplicationId":"de.diplphy.simplpse","description":"Update to full featured version due to low paid app download.\n\nsimple PSE full is an easy to use periodic system of elements (PSE) app & the advanced version of simple PSE. All data of the chemical elements is offline available on the device, so there is no need for an internet connection (except the Wikipedia article).\n\nBeside the possibility to choose an element by name or atomic number Z, the full version allows to search for elements. While typing the first character a list with all matching elements appears. So there is no need to type the full name of the element, you can choose the element you are interested in from a list.\n\nThe app has a full \"Just Type...\" integration, that means you can start a search for an element directly from the \"Just Type...\" input from the start screen of your webOS Phone (therefore you have to select simple PSE full as a new search in the \"Just Type...\" preferences). \n\nThe app is ready for different languages. Currently the app will display all information in German or English dependent on your system language (French & Spain are planed for a update). \n\nAlso a User's Guide was been added to describe all the functions of simple PSE full. I hope you will enjoy the use of simple PSE full as your reference for chemical elements. The app shows the following properties of the chemical element if available:\n- name\n- symbol\n- atomic number\n- atomic weight\n- electronic configuration\n- density\n- melting point\n- boiling point\n- atomic radius\n- covalent radius\n- atomic volume\n- specific heat\n- fusion heat\n- evaporation heat\n- thermal conductivity\n- pauling negativity\n- first ionizing\n- oxidation states\n- lattice structure\n- lattice constant\n- and the Wikipedia article of the chemical element.","version":"1.6.0","versionNote":"search for elements, just type integration, manual","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.diplphy.de","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.diplphy.de","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 DiplPhy","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":67658,"installSize":1015808,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-07-23T16:46:09.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":true,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"de.diplphy.simplpse_1.6.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"de.diplphy.simplpse\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/320x480_320x480_1_argon.png","thumbnail":"de.diplphy.simplpse\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/320x480_75x112_1_argon.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"de.diplphy.simplpse\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/320x480_320x480_1_argon2.png","thumbnail":"de.diplphy.simplpse\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/320x480_75x112_1_argon2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"de.diplphy.simplpse\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/320x480_320x480_1_help.png","thumbnail":"de.diplphy.simplpse\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/320x480_75x112_1_help.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"de.diplphy.simplpse\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/320x480_320x480_1_JustType.png","thumbnail":"de.diplphy.simplpse\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/320x480_75x112_1_JustType.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"de.diplphy.simplpse\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/320x480_320x480_1_search.png","thumbnail":"de.diplphy.simplpse\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/320x480_75x112_1_search.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
