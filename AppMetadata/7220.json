These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nThe Mystery of Edwin Drood is the final novel by Charles Dickens. It is a mystery indeed; the serial novel was just half completed at the time of Dickens\u2019 death \u2013 leading to much speculation how it might have ended.\nThe novel is named after Edwin Drood, one of the characters, but it mostly tells the story of his uncle, a choirmaster named John Jasper, who is in love with his pupil, Rosa Bud. Miss Bud is Drood\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, and has also caught the eye of the high-spirited and hot-tempered Neville Landless! Landless comes from Ceylon with his twin sister, Helena. Neville Landless and Edwin Drood take a dislike to one another the moment they meet.\nThe story is set in Cloisterham, a lightly fictionalised Rochester (in Kent, England). Rochester is close to Dicken\u2019s country house Gad\u2019s Hill Place, where the final chapter was written and where Dickens died.\nAdapted by Alan Chant from the Edwin Drood entry in Wikipedia.\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"288518","installSize":"288518","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.8","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.themysteryofedwindroodaudiotext_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7220\/images\/1\/L\/themysteryofedwindrood1.png","screenshot":"7220\/images\/1\/L\/themysteryofedwindrood1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7220\/images\/2\/L\/themysteryofedwindrood2.png","screenshot":"7220\/images\/2\/L\/themysteryofedwindrood2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
