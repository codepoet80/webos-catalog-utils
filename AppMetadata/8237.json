It was published pseudonymously, even though Evans was a well-published and highly respected scholar of her time. The novel has remained in print ever since, and is used in university studies of 19th century English literature.\n\n    The story\u2019s plot follows four characters rural lives in the fictional community of Hayslope\u2014a rural, pastoral and close-knit community in 1799.
