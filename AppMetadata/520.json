{"publicApplicationId":"com.changeinflux.colors","description":"Aimed at web and graphic designers on the move, Colors brings precise color selection to users without the need for anything more than a webOS device. Using a color wheel consisting of 4,096 colors, a simple swipe of the finger will yield both a standard hexadecimal color value as well as a web safe variant. Previews of both colors assist in choosing the optimal color. These values can be copied to the device's clipboard for later use.  On the go or in conjunction with your workstation, Colors is only a tap away.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/changeinflux.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/changeinflux.com","custsupportemail":"support@changeinflux.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2009 Richard Denton","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":64586,"installSize":1212284,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-01-06T03:03:50.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.changeinflux.colors_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"520\/en\/images\/1\/S\/preview.png","screenshot":"520\/en\/images\/1\/L\/preview.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
