{"publicApplicationId":"com.discipleskies.giantgps","description":"** This app is for Touchpads that have G4 phone service.  Do not install this app if your device does not meet this requirement. **\n\nTurn your Touchpad into a colossal navigation device!  GIANT GPS is the biggest and best of its kind, in fact, its functionality rivals many high priced off-the-shelf GPS units. \n\nDesigned especially for the Palm Touchpad, GIANT GPS allows you to permanently store and manage your waypoints and provides you with the tools to navigate back to them! \n\nEasily navigate to one of your saved waypoints or to any coordinates of your choice. \n\nSave a waypoint as your current position or as any coordinate pair entered into the coordinate module.  Alternatively, when phone service is available, an interactive map allows you to enter a waypoint with a tap of the map.\n\nNavigation tools include 2 compasses- A GPS Controlled Directional Compass & a Waypoint-Finding Compass and reporting for Estimated Time of Arrival, Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Delta Altitude, Heading, Distance to Waypoint and Total Distance Traveled.\n\nTo find your waypoint, just follow the waypoint-finding compass; it will always be pointing to your destination.  Continuous Tracking and a power-saving Non-Continuous Tracking mode are available.   \n\nA record of your trail is stored and can be reviewed at any time on either a world map (when in range of phone service)  or Cartesian grid.\n\nOther features include mapping of your current and target locations and the ability to email your location along with a map of your current position.\n\nThe basic GPS functions and compasses function even if you are out of range for internet and phone service.  This is a great app for use just about anywhere!  \n\n**NOTE:  This app is only for units with a GPS chip and G3 or G4 connectivity and requires the latest system update from the Palm Catalog (webOS 3.0.4).","version":"7.2.0","versionNote":"Now you can view your trail on a world map when in range of phone service.  The  plot of your trail on a 2-D grid is still available.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","custsupportemail":"support@discipleskies.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 Disciple Skies Software","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":5084896,"installSize":9469952,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-08-01T18:02:21.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":3.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.discipleskies.giantgps_7.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.giantgps\/7.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_giant1.png","screenshot":"com.discipleskies.giantgps\/7.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_giant1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.giantgps\/7.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_giant3.png","screenshot":"com.discipleskies.giantgps\/7.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_giant3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.giantgps\/7.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_giant7.png","screenshot":"com.discipleskies.giantgps\/7.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_giant7.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"4":{"thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.giantgps\/7.2.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_giant6.png","screenshot":"com.discipleskies.giantgps\/7.2.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_giant6.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"5":{"thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.giantgps\/7.2.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_giant5.png","screenshot":"com.discipleskies.giantgps\/7.2.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_giant5.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
