{"publicApplicationId":"com.mozzapp.events","description":"Events is a location-sensitive events listing application that can be used to search for your favorite events, book tickets and get driving directions. It lists  nearby events based on your current location or ZIP code (works only in US). You can filter the events by category, keyword (artist name, etc) and range (in miles). The venue can be looked up in Google maps with a single click so that you can obtain driving directions. A link to ticket booking website is also provided (if tickets can be booked online for that event). This application uses the Yahoo Upcoming API to retrieve events list.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/mozzapp.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/mozzapp.com\/moZZapp\/Contact_Us.html","custsupportemail":"support@mozzapp.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"copyright 2009 Mozzapp LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":138756,"installSize":525523,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2009-11-14T16:18:31.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mozzapp.events_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"332\/en\/images\/1\/S\/screenshot1.png","screenshot":"332\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"332\/en\/images\/2\/S\/screenshot2.png","screenshot":"332\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
