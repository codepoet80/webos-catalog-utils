It's way easier and more elegant to show 'em.\n\n\nInstructions:\nTo load or edit an image at the album cover, just hold your finger a few seconds over it. Single tap goes into the album.\n\nAt the opened album, same logic, but single tap makes the image go to fullscreen. If you are on the last image of the album (e.g 2\/2) the \"next\" button will create a new image place.\nYou can give title and description to your images, just click and type whatever you want.\n\nSettings is accessible from the appMenu (top left).\nYou can set up the travel's date, enable\/disable the sounds, a message on title bar (e.g My vacations on Madri) and choose between 4 different themes or customize with your own picture.\n\nOBS: To avoid lag, try to use small or medium image sizes.","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.virtuestudio.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.virtuestudio.com","custsupportemail":"support@virtuestudio.com","custsupportphonenum":"558588790305","copyright":"copyright 2010 Virtue Studio, Inc","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":3657126,"installSize":5275648,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-01-13T20:11:43.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.virtuestudio.travelalbumfree_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"6952\/en\/images\/1\/S\/PTAss1.png","screenshot":"6952\/en\/images\/1\/L\/PTAss1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"6952\/en\/images\/2\/S\/PTAss3.png","screenshot":"6952\/en\/images\/2\/L\/PTAss3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"6952\/en\/images\/3\/S\/PTAss2.png","screenshot":"6952\/en\/images\/3\/L\/PTAss2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
