{"publicApplicationId":"net.minego.pwdhash","description":"The Stanford PwdHash (http:\/\/www.pwdhash.com\/) provides an easy & secure method of creating a unique password for every site you visit.\n                                                                                   \nThe password is created by creating a hash of the site's domain name, and a master password.  The result is that you only have to remember one password, but you get the benefits of having a different password on each site. \n                                                                                        \nThis application uses the same source and algorithms as the Stanford PwdHash site.  If you use the chrome or firefox plugin then the password generated will be the same.\n                                                                                        \nTo use this app go copy the URL from a webpage that requires a username and password.  Then launch the application, and enter your password.  Then simply hit copy, and return to the web browser and paste the password into the password field.\n                                                                                        \nOnce the password has been pasted you can clear the clipboard by tapping on the PwdHash notification.\n                                                                                   \nThis app is provided \"as is\" with no warranties expressed or implied.  Use at your own risk.  This app was developed using the source provided by the Standford PwdHash project, but no one from that project was involved in it's development.  The Standford PwdHash project has not endorsed this project.","version":"1.14.42","versionNote":"This version adds the ability to display the generated password in a popup above another application. This is useful for applications that do not properly support pasting a password.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.minego.net","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.minego.net\/pwdhash","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 Micah N Gorrell","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":567862,"installSize":1441792,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-01-19T08:41:28.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"net.minego.pwdhash_1.14.42_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"net.minego.pwdhash\/1.14.42\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_pwdhash-screen-1.png","screenshot":"net.minego.pwdhash\/1.14.42\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_pwdhash-screen-1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"thumbnail":"net.minego.pwdhash\/1.14.42\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_pwdhash-screen-2.png","screenshot":"net.minego.pwdhash\/1.14.42\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_pwdhash-screen-2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"net.minego.pwdhash\/1.14.42\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_pwdhash-screen-3.png","screenshot":"net.minego.pwdhash\/1.14.42\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_pwdhash-screen-3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
