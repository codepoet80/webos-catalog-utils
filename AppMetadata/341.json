It also includes a parking meter feature that optionally notifies\nthe user of an expiring meter. Once a parking location has been\nremembered, the user can use Google Maps to view it on the map or to see\nthe saved photo and navigate back to the vehicle. Also, the user can\nnotify others via email all saved location, photo, meter and notes\ninformation.  When a location or photo is no longer needed, it can be deleted \nseparately.  For users looking for parking garages and lots, search with either \nthe current GPS location or any address.  I will be continuing to update the \napplication in future releases with new features and popular requests from users.","version":"1.1.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/tidyminds.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/tidyminds.com","custsupportemail":"cocker_ivy@yahoo.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Anning Chen","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":88310,"installSize":2898294,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T00:15:09.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.53,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.anning.wheremycarat_1.1.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"341\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/locationAndPhotoAndDelete.PNG","thumbnail":"341\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/locationAndPhotoAndDelete.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"341\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/meter.PNG","thumbnail":"341\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/meter.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"341\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/parkedAt.PNG","thumbnail":"341\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/parkedAt.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"341\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/4\/L\/email.png","thumbnail":"341\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/4\/L\/email.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"341\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/5\/L\/notes.png","thumbnail":"341\/1.1.3\/en\/images\/5\/L\/notes.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
