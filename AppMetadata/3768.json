{"publicApplicationId":"com.lamberte.holdemtimer","description":"Hold 'em Timer is an easy to use app to keep track of the blinds while playing tournament style Texas Hold 'em Poker with friends and family. Simply press start and the app will do the rest. To change the time per round, the antes and small and\/or big blinds for each round, or even the displayed chip colors, check out the preferences menu from the main menu. \n\nNOW WITH ROUND BREAKS!  Simply create a new break, set the time, and drag it anywhere within the rounds list.  Also, notice the addition of integer pickers as well as the ability to change the ante, blind, or chip increment values.  \n\nChanging the increment values can be very useful to avoid unnecessary scrolling.  For instance set the blind increment to 100 and individual blind pickers will automatically allow you to select 0, 100, 200, etc. (versus the default 0, 5, 10, etc.).","version":"1.0.6","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.lamberte.com\/apps","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.lamberte.com\/apps","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Troy Lamberte","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":957672,"installSize":4390912,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T11:32:11.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.lamberte.holdemtimer_1.0.6_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"3768\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/L\/sspic1.png","thumbnail":"3768\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/L\/sspic1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"3768\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/L\/sspic2.png","thumbnail":"3768\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/L\/sspic2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"3768\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/L\/sspic3.png","thumbnail":"3768\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/L\/sspic3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"3768\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/4\/L\/sspic4.png","thumbnail":"3768\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/4\/L\/sspic4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"3768\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/5\/L\/sspic5.png","thumbnail":"3768\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/5\/L\/sspic5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
