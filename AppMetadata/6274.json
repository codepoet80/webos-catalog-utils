{"publicApplicationId":"com.cesassociates.callme","description":"Call Me! V1.2.1 now includes turning on the screen when the call comes in.\n\n Fool your friends! Receive a (fake) phone call from someone you know, a celebrity, a famous person or a politician! (Enter their photo and a fake phone number in your contact list in advance.)  Schedule a (fake) phone call to give you an excuse to get out of a commitment or a meeting! \n \n Call Me! Generates a fake phone call from someone in your Contact list. This is NOT a real phone call. It simply rings with your selected ringtone and resembles a real phone call in that you must answer or dismiss it as you would a real phone call. As it rings, it shows the large or small screen photo (depending on the photo size) of the caller (from your Contact List). It will ring until you answer or dismiss it. When you answer it, it then shows the answer screen photo of your contact as your real phone call does. That photo will stay on the screen until you end the call as you would in a real phone call. \n \n The main screen displays the Current Settings. Here you see the Contact that will be \"calling\", the time scheduled for the call and your selected ringtone. If you tap the Call ME! button at this time, this is the call that will be made. Or you can take the time to set up a call from a different contact, a different date & time or\/and a different ringtone. \n \n The status of a pending call is shown in the dashboard. Here you can also call up that call to cancel it should you choose. \n \n Preferences, from the Application Menu, allow you to set up defaults.  Help is also available through the Application Menu.\n \n To learn more, go to our website to review the Help system which is the same as that built into the App.","version":"1.2.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/mysite.verizon.net\/charlie.santos\/cesassociates\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/mysite.verizon.net\/charlie.santos\/cesassociates\/support.html","custsupportemail":"charlie.santos@msn.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2010, 2011 Charles.
