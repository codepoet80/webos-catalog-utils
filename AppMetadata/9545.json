{"publicApplicationId":"com.pinetreegeek.match2learn","description":"Increase memory skills while learning basic shapes!  Match2Learn is a children's memory game which will help children improve their memory and learn to recognize things.  \n\nTwo players take turns flipping two cards, and the player with the most matches wins!\n\nThe game currently has a small, medium, and large game mode.  The number of pairs per shape is randomly generated for each game, so no two games will be alike!\n\nRight now it is limited to basic shapes but more matching categories are coming in future releases (such as letters, numbers, and colors)!","version":"1.2.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/pinetreegeek.wordpress.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/pinetreegeek.wordpress.com","custsupportemail":"support@pinetreegeek.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Pine Tree Geek Software","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":8936,"installSize":458752,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T00:44:32.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.pinetreegeek.match2learn_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9545\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_Match2Learn_small.png","thumbnail":"9545\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_Match2Learn_small.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"9545\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_Match2Learn_medium.png","thumbnail":"9545\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_Match2Learn_medium.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"9545\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_Match2Learn_large.png","thumbnail":"9545\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_Match2Learn_large.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
