{"publicApplicationId":"com.speedymarks.palmpre.budget","description":"Stay in control and monitor your daily, weekly or monthly spendings with the help of this budget tracker application. Set yourself a limit and debit all your payments. You can always see how much money is left until your budget is gone and whether you might better postpone a purchase. Over time this should help to save some money instead of going into dept.\n\nOf course this application is not limited to money but you can use it to monitor any limited resource. Just change the unit of the limit.\n","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/budget.speedymarks.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/start.speedymarks.com","custsupportemail":"budget@speedymarks.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2009 SpeedyMarks","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":38804,"installSize":2033726,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-05-31T23:37:03.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.speedymarks.palmpre.budget_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"937\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/palmScreenshot.png","thumbnail":"937\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/palmScreenshot.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"937\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/palmScreenshot2.png","thumbnail":"937\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/palmScreenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
