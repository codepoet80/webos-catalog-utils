These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\n    The Joyful Wisdom (later translated as The Gay Science), written in 1882, just before Zarathustra, is rightly judged to be one of Nietzsche\u2019s best books. Here the essentially grave and masculine face of the poet-philosopher is seen to light up and suddenly break into a delightful smile. The warmth and kindness that beam from his features will astonish those hasty psychologists who have never divined that behind the destroyer is the creator, and behind the blasphemer the lover of life. In the retrospective valuation of his work which appears in Ecce Homo the author himself observes with truth that the fourth book, \u201cSanctus Januarius,\u201d deserves especial attention: \u201cThe whole book is a gift from the Saint, and the introductory verses express my gratitude for the most wonderful month of January that I have ever spent.\u201d Book fifth \u201cWe Fearless Ones\u201d, the Appendix \u201cSongs of Prince Free-as-a-Bird,\u201d and the Preface, were added to the second edition in 1887.\n\n    (Summary by Dr Oscar Levy)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
