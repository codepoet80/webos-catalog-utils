There are three game modes: single player, pass and play, and versus, as well as three levels of difficulty ranging from easy to impossible.  Changes in version 1.0.0: * New dictionary for hard\/impossible modes * Fixed the black screen problem.  * Bomb no longer explodes if sound is turned off in-game.
