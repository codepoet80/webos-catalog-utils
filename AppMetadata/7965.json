It is generally considered to have been based on Ferber\u2019s own experiences growing up in Appleton, Wisconsin. Fanny\u2019s inner struggle between her compassionate, artistic side and her desire for financial independence as a successful young businesswoman is the recurring theme of the novel. Ferber\u2019s engaging style of writing will quickly draw you into her story. Regarded by many to be the \u201cgreatest American woman novelist of her day,\u201d Edna Ferber would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize in a 1925 for her book So Big, and is also the author of Showboat and Cimarron, which along with other of her later works were successfully adapted for stage and screen.
