This is a result of the evils of irrationality and collectivism and the weaknesses of socialistic thinking and economics. As is common in her work, Rand draws a clear distinction between the \"socialist\/communal\" values of equality and brotherhood and the \"productive\/capitalist\" values of achievement and individuality.
