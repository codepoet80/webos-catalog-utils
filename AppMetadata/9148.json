{"publicApplicationId":"com.xanadu.badbooty","description":"Version 1.1: Now available for Veer\/Pixi, TouchPad, and Pre3!\n\nThis isn't your average fart app.  It adds a twist.  Along with (currently) 12 high quality blasts that will make you thankful that we can't electronically deliver odors with an app, it also has an \"Incognito\" mode.  This simulates the standard clock screen when on a Touchstone, but at intervals you specify, it randomly chooses one of the 12 blasts to startle those around you.  You choose the time range in the preferences of the main app, and prepare your finger to point at someone else.  This app also works in Exhibition Mode for more hilarity.  Don't forget to enable it in the main Exhibition Mode preferences.","version":"1.1.1","versionNote":"Now available for Veer\/Pixi, TouchPad, and Pre3!","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.webos-internals.org\/wiki\/BadBooty","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.webos-internals.org\/wiki\/BadBooty","custsupportemail":"xanadu@inorbit.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":541486,"installSize":2031616,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-09-06T17:58:24.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":true,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.xanadu.badbooty_1.1.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9148\/1.1.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_BadBooty1.png","thumbnail":"9148\/1.1.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_BadBooty1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"9148\/1.1.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_BadBooty2.png","thumbnail":"9148\/1.1.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_BadBooty2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"9148\/1.1.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_BadBooty3.png","thumbnail":"9148\/1.1.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_BadBooty3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
