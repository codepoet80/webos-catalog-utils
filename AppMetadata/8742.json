Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell concentrates on knowledge rather than metaphysics.\n\n    Russell guides the reader through his famous distinction between \u201cknowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description\u201d and introduces important theories of Plato, Aristotle, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, David Hume, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Georg Hegel and others, to lay the foundation for philosophical inquiry by general readers and scholars alike.\n\n    (Summary from Wikipedia)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
