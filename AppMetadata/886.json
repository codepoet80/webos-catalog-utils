{"publicApplicationId":"com.naggel.alientube","description":"NOW for the Palm Pre and the TouchPad: the popular \"helicopter game\" in a new style!\n\nNEW: Shake your Pre or TouchPad to go to the SETTINGS menu, where you can choose between different speeds, three difficulties & sound effects.\n\nImagine you're an alien alone on your journey through the universe. You're getting tired and fall asleep. When you wake up you suddenly find yourself in an apparently endless tunnel. Your only chance to survive is to find the exit of the narrow and branched tunnel while avoiding crashing into the walls or obstacles. In this fascinating horizontal scrolling game you control your spaceship with only a single finger tip: touch the screen to climb, release to drop. The farther you get, the higher your score. The game automatically saves your high score so can you compete with yourself and your friends! Simple, but fascinating. Warning, this game is highly addictive!","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/hendi.name\/alientube","supportURL":"http:\/\/hendi.name\/alientube","custsupportemail":"alientube@naggel.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Hendrik Richter","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":145888,"installSize":1432509,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-05-31T23:59:58.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.naggel.alientube_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"886\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_1.png","thumbnail":"886\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"886\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_2.png","thumbnail":"886\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"886\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_3.png","thumbnail":"886\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
