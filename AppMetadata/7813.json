As a player, one would know that the game is self-officiated, that being said, there are tons of arguments. Why not have a mobile version of the rulebook handy when arguments arise? This will help you with all the stupid calls and the people that don't really know the rules.\n\nThis application is a mobile version of the USA Ultimate (once UPA) Rulebook 11th Edition. This is the most up to date version at the moment. Everything from this app is directly from the USAU website.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/jpirog.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/jpirog.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 JPirog","licenseURL":"http:\/\/jpirog.com","locale":null,"appSize":"123462","installSize":"123462","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":0,"currency":"USD","filename":"com.jpirog.usaurules_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":true,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7813\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_usaurules_2011-04-07_080112.png","screenshot":"7813\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_usaurules_2011-04-07_080112.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7813\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_usaurules_2011-04-07_080118.png","screenshot":"7813\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_usaurules_2011-04-07_080118.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7813\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_usaurules_2011-04-07_080124.png","screenshot":"7813\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_usaurules_2011-04-07_080124.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
