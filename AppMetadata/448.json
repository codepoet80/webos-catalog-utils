{"publicApplicationId":"com.haeffb.app.taskadder","description":"TaskAdder is the easy way for Toodledo users to add tasks to your Toodledo account while on the go from your webOS device. It does NOT sync tasks. It provides a simple way to add tasks without having to remember the complicated Toodledo syntax used to enter tasks by email, SMS, etc.  On initial launch, you'll enter your Toodledo login info (email and password). TaskAdder will then login to Toodledo and grab your Folders and Contexts. You can then easily enter a new Task and select Folder, Priority, Due Date, Context, Status and Repeat.  TaskAdder will also allow you to view your Toodledo hotlist to see quickly see which tasks are important today.  ***A free account from http:\/\/www.toodledo.com is required for this app.***","version":"0.5.4","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/haeffb.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/haeffb.com","custsupportemail":"haeffb@yahoo.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2009 Brian A Haeffner","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":64708,"installSize":232895,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2009-12-19T03:01:29.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.haeffb.app.taskadder_0.5.4_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"448\/en\/images\/1\/S\/taskadder_2009-18-11_073407.png","screenshot":"448\/en\/images\/1\/L\/taskadder_2009-18-11_073407.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"448\/en\/images\/2\/S\/taskadder_2009-18-11_073428.png","screenshot":"448\/en\/images\/2\/L\/taskadder_2009-18-11_073428.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"448\/en\/images\/3\/S\/taskadder_2009-01-12_071020.png","screenshot":"448\/en\/images\/3\/L\/taskadder_2009-01-12_071020.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
