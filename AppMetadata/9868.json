{"publicApplicationId":"de.knoopnet.4tprocalc","description":"This app is the 'Pro' version of the free '4tPadCalculator' which is already in the app catalog. '4tPcalculator Pro' provides a scientific calculator with many useful functions (ln\/log\/power\/numeric\/trigonometry). It has lots of additional features to make calculations easier & faster:\n- The editline is designed to enter a calculation according to the usual algebraic notation. Simply tap the [=]-button to get the result.\n- The formula is cached in one of 10 'history' entries and you can browse through the history via buttons. Additionally the 'Pro' version has 6 memory entries, 3 of them are also suited for user defined shortcuts. The default shortcuts for the 'y.th root' [^(1\/y)], 'circumfer.\/area of circle' can be replaced by the user. \n- 4tPcalculator Pro can export formulas and results to the memos app or to the clipboard. \nThe user interface offers several 'preferences': autoAC, AC-lock and education mode. Functions of some special buttons:\n[Round:..] sets the digits to be shown after the point to 0-9.\n[dip] (Display input) inserts 'dip' for the number from the display line into the editfield. Doubletapping this button shows the value of the display directly. The same doubletap feature is provided for the a\/b\/c and y memory.\n[M'in] \/ [M+] \/ [M-] stores the number from the display in the y memory \/ adds\/subtracts the last result to\/from the y memory. \n[rad \/ deg \/ gon] switches through the three usual trignonometry modes. \n[>] \/ [I>I] \/ [>I<] moves the cursor through the editline.\n[Del] \/ [AC] deletes the character in front of the cursor \/ the whole editline (see also autoAC and AC-lock option).\nDue to webOS the app provides a maximum of 13 valid digits of each calculation.\nNobody and even no company is perfect. Therefore you are welcome to send an email to webmaster@knoopnet.de in case of questions or remarks before posting a 'not-so-good-review'. Perhaps we can find a solution.
