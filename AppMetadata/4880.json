{"publicApplicationId":"com.twinhelix.dogcatwhistle","description":"Pet Trainer allows you to train any domesticated pet with ears, it's quite simple.  This app has it all, instead of paying for an expensive dog whistle or training clicker.  You can adjust the whistle from up to 13 different frequencies, most of which you yourself cannot hear.  You can train your pet, your friends or just plain annoy them.  You can also plug your phone into auxiliary speakers to amplify the sound; it is already quite loud... Using Pavlov's theory (classical conditioning) use the sound in conjunction with a positive reinforcement, such as a treat or petting the animal.  Once the animal performs the requested action, use the sound (brief whistle or clicker) followed by a treat or pet.  The animal, in time, will know that the sound means the trick was performed and that they can expect a treat.  Use your favorite search engine to look for video examples of classical conditioning, the possibilities are endless.","version":"1.0.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/twinhelixstudios.blogspot.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/twinhelixstudios.blogspot.com\/","custsupportemail":"nuphonicblue@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Twin Helix Studios","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":5651638,"installSize":7700480,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T06:38:36.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.twinhelix.dogcatwhistle_1.0.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"4880\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/dogcatwhistle_2010-16-08_131156.png","thumbnail":"4880\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/dogcatwhistle_2010-16-08_131156.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"4880\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/dogcatwhistle_2010-16-08_131200.png","thumbnail":"4880\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/dogcatwhistle_2010-16-08_131200.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"4880\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/dogcatwhistle_2010-16-08_131209.png","thumbnail":"4880\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/dogcatwhistle_2010-16-08_131209.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
