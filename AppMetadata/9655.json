Its perfect for jotting down anything!.. Ideal for Shopping Lists, Todo Lists, Forget-me-Nots, Business meetings or pretty much anything you would normally use a note-pad for.  If you purchase this app, please do not provide low ratings without allowing me a chance to fix any issues first.  Since HP\/Palm does not do a very good job of passing along feedback, I would prefer you contact me directly.  You can email me directly at magicminutes@qpaulson.net.  I will reply to your comments \/ feedback as timely as possible.  I appreciate your support - I look forward to building new features and working with you all to make this application successful.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/magicminutes.qpaulson.net","supportURL":"http:\/\/magicminutes.qpaulson.net","custsupportemail":"magicminutes@qpaulson.net","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Squint INC.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1547812,"installSize":4653056,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T00:32:57.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"enyo.qpaulson.magicminutes_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9655\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_ScreenShot.png","thumbnail":"9655\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_ScreenShot.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"9655\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_ScreenShot1.png","thumbnail":"9655\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_ScreenShot1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"9655\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_ScreenShot2.png","thumbnail":"9655\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_ScreenShot2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"9655\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_ScreenShot3.png","thumbnail":"9655\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_ScreenShot3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
