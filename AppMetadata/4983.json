{"publicApplicationId":"com.appbookshop.epub.theguidetomodernslang","description":"Modern language is always changing but never as fast or as much as it has in recent years as modern slang has taken off  in ways that it never has before.  The book \u201cThe Guide to Modern Slang\u201d looks at the reasons why we use slang and why the younger generation is so infatuated with the use of slang words and expressions in ways that older generations never were.  This article also has some examples of modern slang used in North America, such as in Boston and in Canada, where there are very unique slang words and expressions that you won\u2019t hear anywhere else in the world.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","custsupportemail":"support@appbookshop.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright AppBookShop 2010","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":256750,"installSize":3375104,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T07:30:54.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":3.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.appbookshop.epub.theguidetomodernslang_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"4983\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/icon-320x480.png","thumbnail":"4983\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/icon-320x480.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"4983\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/theguidetomodernslang_2010-31-08_103926.png","thumbnail":"4983\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/theguidetomodernslang_2010-31-08_103926.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"4983\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/theguidetomodernslang_2010-31-08_103930.png","thumbnail":"4983\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/theguidetomodernslang_2010-31-08_103930.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"4983\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/theguidetomodernslang_2010-31-08_103934.png","thumbnail":"4983\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/theguidetomodernslang_2010-31-08_103934.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
