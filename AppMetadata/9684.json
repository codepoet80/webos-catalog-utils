{"publicApplicationId":"com.scrollmotion.damagedangelsamotherdiscoverst-9780307368591-rhca","description":"An adoptive mother writes the book she wishes had been available -- sympathetic, up-to-date, useful, hopeful and highly readable -- when her family welcomed a little girl not knowing that she struggled with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). In general, our society has little compassion for those thousands of individuals whose damaged brains lead them to crime, homelessness and addiction. Few realize that they behave as they do as the result of brain damage caused by their mothers\u2019 drinking during pregnancy. FASD is Canada's most common, most expensive, yet most preventable mental disability. FASD can be beaten, but as usual, education is key. This book is a tool that could help the 300,000 Canadians currently affected by FASD, and reduce the number of babies born with FASD in the future.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"6127776","installSize":"6127776","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"24.95","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.damagedangelsamotherdiscoverst-9780307368591-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9684\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9684\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9684\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9684\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9684\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9684\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
