{"publicApplicationId":"com.fridayapps.app.flames","description":"Flames is a capivating and simple fire app.  Use it:  To set a romantic mood, in place of your lighter at your next concert, to let someone know they will burn, for a relaxing diversion, to tell someone they are hot, or just feel a little warmer...  The app includes the sound of fire and an everchanging (not a loop) computer generated flame.  Sound can be turned on and off by tapping the screen.   Note: This app does not actually generate heat and can not be used for cooking.\nBased on xflame under GPLv3.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.fridayapps.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.fridayapps.com","custsupportemail":"info@fridayapps.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Trademark 2010 Fridayapps.com","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1270916,"installSize":1441792,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-09-09T15:56:39.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.fridayapps.app.flames_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"5109\/en\/images\/1\/S\/flame-screenshot.png","screenshot":"5109\/en\/images\/1\/L\/flame-screenshot.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
