You should plan for the best, worst, and expected scenes. When you do this you end up having all your bases covered. You have backup plans to help you with your problems and you also don\u2019t have time to panic because you\u2019ve planned that well. You need to make sure that you look at everything. What\u2019s the worst that can happen? Always plan for the worst, because you never know. While you are planning, make sure that you stay organized. The worst thing that you can do is throw all your beautiful plans in one big pile and expect to find things at last minute or lose vital information. To stay organized you need to keep all your contracts and important information in a binder. When you keep things in the bind you know exactly where everything is and what you need to do at all times. However, bind the papers. When you bind the papers you are more likely to not lose all the information in some accident. Also, make sure you have it on you at all times so that you can immediately put things in the binder. Learn everything you will need to know in this easy to use Event Planning ebook.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","custsupportemail":"support@appbookshop.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright AppBookShop 2010","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":284458,"installSize":6790993,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T04:49:32.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":3.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.appbookshop.epub.theultimateguidetoeventplanning_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"4151\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/theultimateguidetoeventplanning_2010-15-07_063117.png","thumbnail":"4151\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/theultimateguidetoeventplanning_2010-15-07_063117.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"4151\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/theultimateguidetoeventplanning_2010-15-07_063119.png","thumbnail":"4151\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/theultimateguidetoeventplanning_2010-15-07_063119.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"4151\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/theultimateguidetoeventplanning_2010-15-07_063124.png","thumbnail":"4151\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/theultimateguidetoeventplanning_2010-15-07_063124.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
