{"publicApplicationId":"com.qnsapps.enyo.md5lookup","description":"This application will take a given MD5 hash and run it through several databases to see if there is already a known matching string.  If so, that is shown.  In effect, it can \"reverse\" an MD5, if that MD5 hash is known.\n\nFinally, codes are saved and kept until you delete them. So you don't have to worry about re-entering codes!\n\nMD5 Lookup is powered by noisette at http:\/\/md5.noisette.ch.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.john-am.com\/qns-apps\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.john-am.com\/qns-apps\/","custsupportemail":"jabdulma@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 QNS Apps.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2378838,"installSize":36765696,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-08-09T17:17:05.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.qnsapps.enyo.md5lookup_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10095\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_08062011SS_01.png","thumbnail":"10095\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_08062011SS_01.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10095\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_08062011SS_02.png","thumbnail":"10095\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_08062011SS_02.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"10095\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_08062011SS_03.png","screenshot":"10095\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_08062011SS_03.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
