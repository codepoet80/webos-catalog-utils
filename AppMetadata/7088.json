Their meeting proves providential not only for Amy\u2019s life, but for the whole Dorrit family, whose new rise will, in many ways, be also their fall. As in all his novels, in \u201cLittle Dorrit\u201d Dickens ushers us into a fascinating and startlingly rich world of human characters and destinies, where virtue and nobility cross swords with vice and villainy, where strength and weakness intertwine with prejudice and magnanimity and where the author\u2019s inspired pen wields a compelling and unforgettable power over the readers.
