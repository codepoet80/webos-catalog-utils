{"publicApplicationId":"com.scrollmotion.deloumeroad-9780307373946-rhca","description":"From a breathtakingly talented new writer: a beautifully written, gripping novel that weaves storytelling magic, life, love, and tragedy into the beauty of the Canadian landscape. \"Deloume Road\" takes us into a hot August month on Vancouver Island during the first Gulf War, to a small rural community where the children's lives play out unchangingly in the woods and secret places - until they discover an object from the past that will come to haunt them all. Slowly we discover how intertwined are the lives of recent comers with long established neighbours. Matthew Hooton, with lovely skill, and an assured voice, creates an indelible sense of a small community along a country road and the ties that bind us, celebrating the differences and connections between the Korean language and English, between losing a loved one to war and pulling the trigger, about summer and the first rain.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"5596994","installSize":"5596994","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"29.95","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.deloumeroad-9780307373946-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9694\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9694\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9694\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9694\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9694\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9694\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
