The title is from him.\n\n    Mr Watson is a widowed clergyman with two sons and four daughters. The youngest daughter, Emma, has been brought up by a wealthy aunt and is consequently better educated and more refined than her sisters. But when her aunt contracts a foolish second marriage, Emma is obliged to return to her father\u2019s house. There she is chagrined by the crude and reckless husband-hunting of two of her twenty-something sisters.\n    (Summary from Gesine and Wikipedia)\n\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
