{"publicApplicationId":"com.appible.onwar","description":"On War is a book on war and military strategy by Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz, written mostly after the Napoleonic wars, between 1816 and 1830, and published posthumously by his wife in 1832. It has been translated into English several times as On War. On War is actually an unfinished work; Clausewitz had set about revising his accumulated manuscripts in 1827, but did not live to finish the task. His wife eventually compiled his work, leaving out his later revisions, and finishing the final two chapters either herself or with assistance from an unknown government official. --Wikipedia.org--","version":"1.5.8","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"714150","installSize":"714150","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"0.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.onwar_1.5.8_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"2253\/de\/images\/1\/L\/10nwar.png","screenshot":"2253\/de\/images\/1\/L\/10nwar.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2253\/de\/images\/2\/L\/20nwar.png","screenshot":"2253\/de\/images\/2\/L\/20nwar.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2253\/de\/images\/3\/L\/30nwar.png","screenshot":"2253\/de\/images\/3\/L\/30nwar.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2253\/de\/images\/4\/L\/40nwar.png","screenshot":"2253\/de\/images\/4\/L\/40nwar.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
