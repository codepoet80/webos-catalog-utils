{"publicApplicationId":"com.verizon.fiostv","description":"Verizon FiOS DVRs have always given viewers the ability to watch what they want, when they want. Now, Verizon is making its DVRs even more accessible by giving customers the ability to program them remotely through their mobile devices. That means that Verizon FiOS customers never have to worry about missing anything they want to watch, as they\u2019ll always be able to set their DVRs to record from virtually anywhere they happen to be. It also means that customers can set parental controls, set bookmarks, browse and search TV programming, view the DVR status to see how much space is left for recording, browse and search VOD listings, and see their lists of scheduled and recorded programs.","version":"1.0.6","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www36.verizon.com\/fiostv\/web","supportURL":"https:\/\/www36.verizon.com\/fiostv\/web\/UnProtected\/Help.aspx","custsupportemail":"palm-appsupport@core.verizon.com","custsupportphonenum":"8885531555","copyright":"Copyright2009 Verizon Information Technologies LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":936140,"installSize":11418326,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-06-02T08:06:32.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.verizon.fiostv_1.0.6.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"3172\/en\/images\/1\/S\/VerizonFiOSDVRManagerScr1.png","screenshot":"3172\/en\/images\/1\/L\/VerizonFiOSDVRManagerScr1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"3172\/en\/images\/2\/S\/VerizonFiOSDVRManagerScr2.png","screenshot":"3172\/en\/images\/2\/L\/VerizonFiOSDVRManagerScr2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"3172\/en\/images\/3\/S\/VerizonFiOSDVRManagerScr3.png","screenshot":"3172\/en\/images\/3\/L\/VerizonFiOSDVRManagerScr3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"3172\/en\/images\/4\/S\/VerizonFiOSDVRManagerScr4.png","screenshot":"3172\/en\/images\/4\/L\/VerizonFiOSDVRManagerScr4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
