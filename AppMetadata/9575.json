Mordecai himself chose the pieces to include in \"Dispatches from the Sporting Life\", and together they give us an intimate portrait of a man who admired the players and prized the struggle of sport -- as much as he enjoyed skewering those who made a mockery of its principles.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"5307032","installSize":"5307032","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"14.04","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.dispatchesfromthesportinglife-9780307371010-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9575\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9575\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9575\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9575\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9575\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9575\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
