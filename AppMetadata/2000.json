{"publicApplicationId":"com.appible.persuasion","description":"Persuasion was Austen's final completed novel and was written between 1815 and 1816, and published incompletely revised immediately after her death with Northanger Abbey. As so often in Austen's novels, Persuasion concerns the social issues of her time and particularly the matter of class. The story begins with the letting of Sir Walter Elliot's seat, Kellynch Hall, to his annoyance as a man of self-aggrandising and showy tendencies. Persuasion is the tale of the romance between his pretty and friendly younger daughter Anne who meets the novel's hero, Captain Wentworth and in spite of social barriers and the rival Musgrove sisters - Louisa and Henrietta - pursues his affection having once turned him down as a spouse. Accidents and various engagements ensue leading to what the reader hopes will be another finale of poetic justice and requited love. \"Bibliomania.com\"","version":"1.5.8","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"629034","installSize":"629034","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"0.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.persuasion_1.5.8_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"2000\/de\/images\/1\/L\/1persuasion.png","screenshot":"2000\/de\/images\/1\/L\/1persuasion.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2000\/de\/images\/2\/L\/2persuasion.png","screenshot":"2000\/de\/images\/2\/L\/2persuasion.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2000\/de\/images\/3\/L\/3persuasion.png","screenshot":"2000\/de\/images\/3\/L\/3persuasion.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2000\/de\/images\/4\/L\/4persuasion.png","screenshot":"2000\/de\/images\/4\/L\/4persuasion.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
