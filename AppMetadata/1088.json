{"publicApplicationId":"co.uk.leedjones.birdwatch","description":"Twitter is more than your average social networking site, its rapidly becoming *the* primary online communication tool. While many superb tools and applications exist to monitor your public feeds, little exists to help with targeted messaging such as @replies and direct messages.  As more and more people communicate both publicly and privately via twitter, and as the service grows in popularity, its becoming increasingly important (and difficult) to monitor what people say to and about you. Whether you're an individual or a business, its vital to know when you've been mentioned, and this is where Birdwatch can help.\n\nBirdwatch is a small background application written for WebOS. The tool runs autonomously, periodically checking Twitter for new tweets where your registered username has a reply\/mention or direct message. Birdwatch then presents a dashboard stage allowing you to scroll through new, unseen messages ensuring you do not miss any important information or cut vital conversations short.\n\nThe application runs in the background, completely closing between iterations, meaning no drain or resource consumption is used by the application when not in use. Start, configure and leave it run in the background \u2013 never miss a DM or @reply again!\n***********************************************\nNow with support for OAuth, giving you increased security and ongoing compatibility with the twitter API\n***********************************************","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.leedjones.co.uk","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.leedjones.co.uk","custsupportemail":"birdwatch@leedjones.co.uk","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 LeeDJones","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":212010,"installSize":3496461,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T03:51:51.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"co.uk.leedjones.birdwatch_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"1088\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/090options320x480.png","thumbnail":"1088\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/090options320x480.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"1088\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/090reply320x480.png","thumbnail":"1088\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/090reply320x480.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"1088\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/090settings320x480.png","thumbnail":"1088\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/090settings320x480.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"1088\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/090newmentions320x480.png","thumbnail":"1088\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/090newmentions320x480.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"1088\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/090Checkforupdates320x480.png","thumbnail":"1088\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/090Checkforupdates320x480.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
