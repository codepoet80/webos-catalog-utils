{"publicApplicationId":"com.chickenfarm.croprotatego","description":"Have you wanted to crop or rotate a photo to send to a friend, but did not want to wait until you got in front of a computer? Well, now you can do just that :)  Open an existing photo or take a new picture from within the application.  You can crop part of a photo, and rotate it 360 degrees all with a cool animation.  Right now works best with portrait photos (tall photos) better landscape support (wide photos) will come soon in future updates.  At this moment, saving photos is done by taking a screenshot. This the number one priority for future updates and we are working hard to implement this natively. Many new features will be added through free updates.","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/chickenfarm.wordpress.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/chickenfarm.wordpress.com\/","custsupportemail":"chickenfarmsoftware@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyriht 2010 Chickenfarm","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1947994,"installSize":5560943,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T03:17:02.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.chickenfarm.croprotatego_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"3561\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/croprotategolite_2010-16-06_182808.png","thumbnail":"3561\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/croprotategolite_2010-16-06_182808.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"3561\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/croprotategolite_2010-16-06_183048.png","thumbnail":"3561\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/croprotategolite_2010-16-06_183048.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"3561\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/croprotategolite_2010-16-06_182738.png","thumbnail":"3561\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/croprotategolite_2010-16-06_182738.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
