Seventeen year-old Catherine spends her time visiting newly-made friends, such as Isabella Thorpe, and going to balls. Catherine finds herself pursued by Isabella\u2019s brother John Thorpe (Catherine\u2019s brother James\u2019s friend from university), and by Henry Tilney. She also becomes friends with Eleanor Tilney, Henry\u2019s younger sister. Henry captivates her with his view on novels and his knowledge of history and the world. General Tilney (Henry and Eleanor\u2019s father) invites Catherine to visit their estate, Northanger Abbey, which, because she has been reading Ann Radcliffe\u2019s gothic novel The Mysteries of Udolpho, Catherine expects to be dark, ancient and full of fantastical mystery.
