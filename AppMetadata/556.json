{"publicApplicationId":"com.edmiller.navpro","description":"(English only) **Significant accuracy improvement**  NavPro is a GPS navigation program which tracks speed, time, and distance. ++ Also indicates course heading and latitude\/longitude.  ++ Acceleration response is optimized for biking, hiking, sailing and similar activities. ***Note, this makes the response appear slow if you test it in an automobile, but it provides much more accurate readings for low-acceleration activities.***   Data filtering for greater accuracy.  ++ Course heading dial indicates direction of motion (note - it does not respond like a compass to the device's orientation; rather, it indicates the direction in which you are traveling).  ++ Link to launch map of current location. ++ While tracking, prevents the device from going into sleep mode -- returns to normal timeout when stopped \/ paused, or when minimized to 'card' mode. ++  Displays in English or metric units. ++ Displays current, maximum, or average speed.
