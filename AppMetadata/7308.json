All have, in some way, touched or been touched by the loveable, young, simple-minded \u201cidiot,\u201d Barnaby Rudge.\n\n    Barnaby\u2019s good nature makes him a joy to most who know him Unfortunately, his eagerness to please and his gullibility make him an easy prey for the unscrupulous. Can he emerge unscathed when once he gets tangled up with the wrong crowd?\n\n    Once again, Dickens has managed to temper the horrific with his characteristic wit and humor, as he tells this tale based on the \u201cno-popery\u201d or Gordon riots of 1780.\n\n    (Note: If the bird in this story seems familiar, it may be because he was the inspiration for Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s poem, \u201cThe Raven.\u201d) (Summary by Debra Lynn)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
