{"publicApplicationId":"com.appible.thegameoflifeandhowtoplayitaudiotext","description":"This Plus version of The Game of Life And How to Play It includes both audio and text so you can follow along or read without the audio.\n\nIn this app you can download & store chapters for listening without an internet connection, perhaps on your next flight or road trip. These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nFlorence Scovel Shinn, an illustrator living in New York City, became a teacher of New Thought after a divorce. New Thought was a movement which holds the belief that individuals can create their own reality through intentional thoughts and prayer, much like the current Law of Attraction movement. The Game of Life and How to Play It is her first book, and is remarkable for being written by a woman and meant for a genteel female audience.\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"291694","installSize":"291694","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.8","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.thegameoflifeandhowtoplayitaudiotext_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7366\/images\/1\/L\/thegameoflifeandhowtoplayit1.png","screenshot":"7366\/images\/1\/L\/thegameoflifeandhowtoplayit1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7366\/images\/2\/L\/thegameoflifeandhowtoplayit2.png","screenshot":"7366\/images\/2\/L\/thegameoflifeandhowtoplayit2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
