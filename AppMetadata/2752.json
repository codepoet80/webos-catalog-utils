{"publicApplicationId":"com.shanerooni.guesswhat","description":"***Updated: v1.1.0 - see update description at the bottom.***  Remember the game GuessWho?  This app gives you more options and more fun than that classic!  Here is a comment one beta tester emailed me: \"I like the responsiveness, styling, zoom feature, and addictiveness. I will definitely be one of the first ones downloading this when it hits the catalog!\"  This is a simple question & answer game, but its simplicity doesn't lack addictiveness!  There are options to play a 1 player (against the computer) or a 2 player (passing the device back and forth).  You can also choose to play with Shapes (very simple), Animals (increased detail) or People (more complex detail).  Watch the video on this page to see a complete tutorial before downloading.  If you have any issues, please use the \"CONTACT\" button on the menu before leaving a negative review.  Your issue will be resolved quickly!  This app is a perfect purchase whether it's for your child, or it's a game you want to play with your child.  It's also great to kill time - even if you're just a kid at heart!  GuessWhat? offers repeatable and addictive game play.  Have fun!  v1.1.0 - in the options menu, allows you to remove the prompts when passing to the next player - just remember you won't be prompted when you hit the 'Pass' button (thanks Debra V).  Also fixed a blue eyed bug in the people game pointed out by Sana C (thanks!).","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.shanerooni.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.shanerooni.com","custsupportemail":"admin@shanerooni.com","custsupportphonenum":"4846542668","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Shanerooni, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":3067338,"installSize":19146893,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T02:26:47.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jUa3NZvqpEI","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/jUa3NZvqpEI\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.shanerooni.guesswhat_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"2752\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/guesswhat_2010-25-04_221831.png","thumbnail":"2752\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/guesswhat_2010-25-04_221831.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"2752\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/guesswhat_2010-25-04_221842.png","thumbnail":"2752\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/guesswhat_2010-25-04_221842.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"2752\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/guesswhat_2010-25-04_221854.png","thumbnail":"2752\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/guesswhat_2010-25-04_221854.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
