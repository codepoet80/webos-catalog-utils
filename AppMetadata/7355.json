These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nOne of James\u2019s favorite short novels, the Aspern Papers tells of the efforts of the nameless narrator to procure the papers of a famous, but now dead, American poet. His attempts to secure them from the poet\u2019s former lover and her niece, now recluses in Venice, are stymied both by them, and by his own mistakes in his quest. \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"280326","installSize":"280326","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.8","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.theaspernpapersaudiotext_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7355\/images\/1\/L\/theaspernpapers1.png","screenshot":"7355\/images\/1\/L\/theaspernpapers1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7355\/images\/2\/L\/theaspernpapers2.png","screenshot":"7355\/images\/2\/L\/theaspernpapers2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
