{"publicApplicationId":"com.mikagika.stan","description":"***New in this edition:  Stan's Stanzas\u2014Stan woos you with poetry.  Stan's Candy Hearts---See what fun phrases he found on his candy hearts.  Added hundreds of words and sentences.  Nixed most of the conversational sentences for more romantic ones.***\n\nLooking for a sweetie who has kind, romantic, and complimentary things to say to you?  Or have you found such a sweetie but sometimes he's too busy to share his feelings?  Stan the Stand-in Sweetie is available whenever you want.  \n\nStan has hundreds of compliments\/suggestions\/sweet-nothings to tell you.  He also has lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives & adverbs to fill in his sentences.  The results may be sweet, funny, romantic, strange or just nonsensical.  (Hey, Stan never promised to be the perfect sweetie.)\n\nDo you know what you'd like to hear but no one says it?  Offer Stan a word or two and he will fill them into his next sentence, albeit perhaps not in the way you expected!  And when you're done with your \u201ctalk\u201d, or a real-life sweetie stops by, Stan is never jealous or insulted.\n\nStan\u2019s sentences should all be clean, like what you would find in a family-friendly card store.  Now if you tell Stan to use R- or X-rated words, you may end up with a sentence from an \u201cadults-only\u201d card store.  Don't blame Stan; you made him do it.","version":"1.3.00","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/standinsweetie\/index.html","custsupportemail":"help@mikagika.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 mikagika, ltd.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":70302,"installSize":1507328,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-02-02T07:51:02.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mikagika.stan_1.3.00_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2862\/en\/images\/1\/S\/stan_shot1.png","screenshot":"2862\/en\/images\/1\/L\/stan_shot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"2862\/en\/images\/2\/S\/stan_shot2.png","screenshot":"2862\/en\/images\/2\/L\/stan_shot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"2862\/en\/images\/3\/S\/stan_shot3.png","screenshot":"2862\/en\/images\/3\/L\/stan_shot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"2862\/en\/images\/4\/S\/stan_shot4.png","screenshot":"2862\/en\/images\/4\/L\/stan_shot4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"2862\/en\/images\/5\/S\/stan_shot5.png","screenshot":"2862\/en\/images\/5\/L\/stan_shot5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
