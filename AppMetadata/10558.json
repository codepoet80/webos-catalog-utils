{"publicApplicationId":"com.webosroundup.tablet","description":"webOSroundup XL is the extra large version of the very popular webOSroundup To Go app for phones, but completely redesigned (and from a different developer).\n\nThis application was developed by Appstuh founder and developer Arthur Thornton, a contributor to webOSroundup. It was designed with the user in mind, allowing you to view articles of the following categories:\n\n-News\n-App Reviews\n-preNotes\n-webOS Meetups\n-webOSRadio\n-Apps of the Day\n-Tips & Tricks\n-Promo Codes\/promoRoundup\n\nThe app sports a unique user interface, optimized for the big screen. You tap on a category and articles from that category open in a special box in the middle, allowing you to scroll through them and select which article you want to view.\n\nWhen you choose an article to view, the article appears on the left side with the comments on the right side. From this screen you can share the article via Twitter (supports Spaz HD, Glimpse, and Quick Post) or Facebook.  You can also comment on the article.\n\nFinally, you can open the WOR forums (opens in the browser) by tapping on the Forums icon or you can send us a tip by tapping on the Tip Us icon.\n\nThe application is open source, using the MIT license.\n\nIf you find bugs or would like a feature to be added, please post them on the webOSroundup XL post in the Appstuh developer forum on the webOSroundup forums.\n\nIf you're a developer, feel free to fork the code, it's available on GitHub at https:\/\/github.com\/Appstuh\/webOSroundup_XL. We will most likely take your contributions and include them in a future update.","version":"0.2.2","versionNote":"Preferences\nNew tweet options (Glimpse and Quick Post)\nReplying to comments\nNew way to determine landscape or portrait orientation","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.webosroundup.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/forums.webosroundup.com\/index.php?threads\/webosroundup-xl.1004\/","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Appstuh and webOSroundup","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":338274,"installSize":1966080,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-04-12T23:35:05.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.webosroundup.tablet_0.2.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"com.webosroundup.tablet\/0.2.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/768x1024_320x480_tb_tablet_2011-05-11_010903.png","screenshot":"com.webosroundup.tablet\/0.2.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_tb_tablet_2011-05-11_010903.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.webosroundup.tablet\/0.2.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_tablet_2011-05-11_010843.png","thumbnail":"com.webosroundup.tablet\/0.2.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_tablet_2011-05-11_010843.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.webosroundup.tablet\/0.2.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_tablet_2011-05-11_010719.png","thumbnail":"com.webosroundup.tablet\/0.2.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_tablet_2011-05-11_010719.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"thumbnail":"com.webosroundup.tablet\/0.2.2\/en\/images\/4\/S\/768x1024_320x480_tb_tablet_2011-05-11_010822.png","screenshot":"com.webosroundup.tablet\/0.2.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_tb_tablet_2011-05-11_010822.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.webosroundup.tablet\/0.2.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_tablet_2011-05-11_010819.png","thumbnail":"com.webosroundup.tablet\/0.2.2\/en\/images\/5\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_tablet_2011-05-11_010819.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
