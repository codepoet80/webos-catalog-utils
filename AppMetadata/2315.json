{"publicApplicationId":"com.invasivebamboo.virusdefense","description":"Virus Defense is the first tower defense style game for your Palm Pre or Pixi. You are tech support for We-B-Geeks and your job is to stop an onslaught of attacks on your customers PC. Virus, bots, worms, Trojans attack and you have to throw up basic Defense Code to stop them. You can choose firewalls, anti-virus code, cleaners, shields and blockers to aid you in stopping these attacks. \nThe only problem is you have a limited amount of memory to use to run your Defense Code. Every piece of code requires a certain amount of memory but you are so overrun with these bad viruses that you can only run very basic Defense Code to begin with. As you destroy the creeps you free up a little bit more memory each time and you can install even better and better Defense Code and upgrade to later versions. \nInvasive Bamboo is committed to updating Virus Defense and adding fresh new levels to this game. Keep your eyes open for updates as we enhance Virus Defense just for you. We listen to your feedback and continue to provide new challenges and features for this siege style game.\nPalm Pre and Pixi tested.\n\n*Update * Level 15 is now possible.
