{"publicApplicationId":"com.andytevans.mortgagepal","description":"Available in: English. Mortgage Pal is a simple application to help you decide how much you can afford when buying a house. Unlike other Morgage calculators, it focuses on total monthly cost of ownership to give you an idea of just how much you will need to spend each month. It also will let you save favorite loan calculations or information for later or comparison. It also has a handy term and help section to help you understand whats going on in the world of realty, banking and loans. Check the menu out for the current prime rate now too! If you would like to see a feature added or find any bugs, please do not hesitate to email me. *UPDATES* Added Current Interest Rates in menu, down payment percent calculations, PMI options, bug fixes, and few other small requested options.","version":"1.2.8","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/coolate.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/coolate.com","custsupportemail":"coolate@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Andy T.
