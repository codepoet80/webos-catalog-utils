{"publicApplicationId":"com.mobileappmakerscom.gomikey","description":"The object of this game is to help Mikey fly through the ever-faster approaching holes in the wall. Position his arms by moving his elbows and hands, and position his legs by moving his knees and feet. When you are ready, press the Go button. As the levels get harder, you may have to rotate Mikey and move him around. Oh, and by the way, you'd better hurry, because each level gets faster! Enjoy the many levels this game has to offer...each with a maniacally shaped hole, and each requiring new mind-bending skills to figure out.  *** WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION ***  Game play now includes 3 lives, giving you another chance on those tough boards.  For new high scores, player initials and date are now recorded.","version":"1.0.4","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.mobileappmakers.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.mobileappmakers.com\/","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 MobileAppMakers.com","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.mobileappmakers.com\/","locale":null,"appSize":"5684690","installSize":"5684690","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"0.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.mobileappmakerscom.gomikey_1.0.4_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"2265\/images\/1\/L\/GoMikeyScreenShot1.png","screenshot":"2265\/images\/1\/L\/GoMikeyScreenShot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2265\/images\/2\/L\/GoMikeyScreenShot2.png","screenshot":"2265\/images\/2\/L\/GoMikeyScreenShot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2265\/images\/3\/L\/GoMikeyScreenShot3.png","screenshot":"2265\/images\/3\/L\/GoMikeyScreenShot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2265\/images\/4\/L\/GoMikeyScreenShot4.png","screenshot":"2265\/images\/4\/L\/GoMikeyScreenShot4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"2265\/images\/5\/L\/GoMikeyScreenShot5.png","screenshot":"2265\/images\/5\/L\/GoMikeyScreenShot5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
