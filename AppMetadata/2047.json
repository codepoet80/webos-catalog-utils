{"publicApplicationId":"org.kered.wheresmycar","description":"--== NEW FEATURES FOR 1.4: now automatically saves your location when you close, and loads it back when you next start the app ==-- --== NEW FEATURES FOR 1.3:  location saving; GPS signal strength meters; english headings ==--  Where's My Car? helps you find your car in a crowded parking lot.  When you leave your car, simply open the application.  (It will automatically get your current GPS location)  Leave the application open, and when you're done doing whatever it is you have to do, click \"Take Me To It!\"  An arrow will show up (as well as a distance measurement).  Simply walk in the direction of the arrow, and you'll be quickly guided back to your car!  PS: I originally wrote this app as a present for my wife, who had mentioned it as what she most wished her Pixi could do.  :)  I've decided to place it on the App Store as a FREE app because I don't see why other similar apps charge $2-5 for such a simple feature.  Let me know if you like it!  :)  PPS: This is only as accurate as the GPS signal your phone can pick up.  If the signal is good, you get back to your car.  If it's bad, it'll walk you right off a cliff.  And if you're under a concrete parking garage floor, it's just not going to work at all!  Don't give me a bad review because I'm obeying the laws of physics!  =)","version":"1.4.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/allurstuff.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.allurstuff.com\/static\/wheresmycar.html","custsupportemail":"us@allurstuff.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 AllUrStuff Incorporated","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":46384,"installSize":1468251,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-04-08T12:38:59.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"org.kered.wheresmycar_1.4.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2047\/en\/images\/1\/S\/wheresmycar_1.png","screenshot":"2047\/en\/images\/1\/L\/wheresmycar_1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"2047\/en\/images\/2\/S\/wheresmycar_2.png","screenshot":"2047\/en\/images\/2\/L\/wheresmycar_2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"2047\/en\/images\/3\/S\/wheresmycar_3.png","screenshot":"2047\/en\/images\/3\/L\/wheresmycar_3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"2047\/en\/images\/4\/S\/wheresmycar_4.png","screenshot":"2047\/en\/images\/4\/L\/wheresmycar_4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
