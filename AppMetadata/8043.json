His experiences in the trenches, including his ultimate wounding and convalescence, became this book. When published in 1917, it was a major hit and helped the recruiting effort when America entered the Great War.\n\n    If you\u2019ve heard of the horror of trench warfare in WWI and want to see it from below dirt level, Empey offers it all here.\n\n    Also included is Empey\u2019s popular \u201cTommy\u2019s Dictionary of the Trenches\u201d which humorously demistifies the slang used by the British soldier. (Summary by Mark F. Smith)\n\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
