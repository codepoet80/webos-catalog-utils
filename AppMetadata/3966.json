Like Scavenger Hunts? Like Riddles? Mobile Cash Quest is a scavenger hunt for your Palm phone where you compete against other players. Points are awarded to all players who complete my 10 riddles. Points can be redeemed for CASH prizes and used to buy hints for future Quests. A new Quest is launched every Monday (CASH Prizes) and Friday (Points Only) with a theme connected to a letter of the alphabet (EXAMPLES: Animals, Birthdays, Cities, Dogs, Electric, etc). Each set contains 26 Quests (Themes from A to Z). Since this is a LIVE scavenger hunt you may join players who have been playing for weeks. ONLY People using the PAID App are eligible for CASH Prizes - so, even if you do not finish in position #1 you may get CASH. The top three PAID App players who finish in the top 100 spots will win CASH Prizes. All riddles are created by one person (me) and over time you will see patterns emerge. You can join us on Facebook and share the fun with other players\u2026 I send out Twitter updates to let you know when the Quest are starting. Visit my website and see Riddles & Answers from past Quests... Riddles can have photos, songs, music, or video.","version":"1.4.4","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.mobilecashquest.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.mobilecashquest.com","custsupportemail":"webmaster@mobilecashquest.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2010 WFCentral.com","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":391022,"installSize":8280246,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T06:02:10.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.5,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.wfcentralcom.mcashq2_1.4.4_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"3966\/1.4.4\/en\/images\/1\/L\/bkg-splash0.png","thumbnail":"3966\/1.4.4\/en\/images\/1\/L\/bkg-splash0.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"3966\/1.4.4\/en\/images\/2\/L\/mcashq_2010-13-05_083121.png","thumbnail":"3966\/1.4.4\/en\/images\/2\/L\/mcashq_2010-13-05_083121.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"3966\/1.4.4\/en\/images\/3\/L\/mcashq2_2010-13-07_203812.png","thumbnail":"3966\/1.4.4\/en\/images\/3\/L\/mcashq2_2010-13-07_203812.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
