{"publicApplicationId":"com.scrollmotion.conceitanovel-9780307373380-rhca","description":"Conceit brings to life the teeming, bawdy streets of London, the intrigue-ridden court, and the lushness of the seventeenth-century English countryside. It is a story of many kinds of love; erotic, familial, unrequited, and obsessive; and the unpredictable workings of the human heart. With characters plucked from the pages of history, Mary Novik's debut novel is an elegant, fully-imagined story of lives you will find hard to leave behind.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"5837762","installSize":"5837762","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"13.37","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.conceitanovel-9780307373380-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9551\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9551\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9551\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9551\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9551\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9551\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
