The flowers which were my solace and pleasure suggested titles for the tales and gave an interest to the work.\n\n    If my girls find a little beauty or sunshine in these common blossoms, their old friend will not have made her Garland in vain.\u201d \u2013 L.M. Alcott, September, 1887\n\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
