{"publicApplicationId":"com.anning.trakbotmapsapi","description":"This application offers a free bare\nbones api to Google Maps.  Since Google Maps charges fees for developers using their maps api in their paid application, I have created a free app that you can launch from your application, passing in some basic input parameters to use Google maps api for free.  Download this application and read the help for further instructions.  This app is intended for developers only.
