{"publicApplicationId":"com.tealpoint.teallevl","description":"Taking utility to a whole new level, TealLevel includes unique and invaluable features never seen before in a leveling app.  Of course, your normal bubble-style levels are there, and you even get a choice of paired \"T\" style levels or a round bubble level with digital readout suitable for flat surfaces.  \n\nHowever, TealLevel also includes a vehicle and RV leveler that calculates the necessary jacking or blocking heights for each tire.  For flight enthusiasts, there is an artificial horizon (gyro) display, perfect for keeping that \"in-the-air\" feeling wherever you go.  \n\nTealLevel is fully configurable, allowing full calibration so you can compensate for individual devices and cases, as features exclusive noise reduction to give you a steady reading.  Best of all, there is a voice playback mode you can enable by turn your handheld upside down.  In this orientation, your data is then read aloud to you, letting you take advantage of your phone's flattest surface at the same time.\n\nUPDATE: Version 1.2 adds new preferences option to add extra dampening to flight level for use during a bumpy ride","version":"1.2.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.tealpoint.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.tealpoint.com","custsupportemail":"support@tealpoint.com","custsupportphonenum":"8008817256","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2009-2010 TealPoint Software","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1142820,"installSize":8173687,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T04:32:28.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":4.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.tealpoint.teallevl_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":[]}
