{"publicApplicationId":"com.heartlandtechnologies.missouririver2","description":"I developed an app named \u2018Missouri River Flood Levels \u2013 2011\u2019. All of the data that feeds this app is from the National Weather Service. When the app is opened you are presented with a list of the seven states that the Missouri River flows through. You click a state and then you are presented with the locations in that state that the National Weather Service has an RSS feed for. For example, there are three locations for Iowa:  Sioux City, Plattsmouth, & La Platte. Now if you tap on Sioux City the data is displayed with:\n\n1.\tAlert Stage\n2.\tFlood Stage\n3.\tLatest Observation\n4.\tObservation Time\n5.\tHighest Forecast\n6.\tHighest Forecast Time\n7.\tLast Forecast\n8.\tLast Forecast Time\n\nI have also added some customizations that allow you to delete states that you are not interested in","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.heartlandtechnologies.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.heartlandtechnologies.com","custsupportemail":"jnorman@heartlandtechnologies.com","custsupportphonenum":"8162329919","copyright":"copyright 2011 Heartland Technology Solutions","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":89988,"installSize":1540096,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-07-08T04:41:56.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.heartlandtechnologies.missouririver2_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"9689\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_Screenshot1_StateList.png","screenshot":"9689\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_Screenshot1_StateList.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"9689\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_Screenshot2_LocationList.png","screenshot":"9689\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_Screenshot2_LocationList.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"9689\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_Screenshot3_DetailView.png","screenshot":"9689\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_Screenshot3_DetailView.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
