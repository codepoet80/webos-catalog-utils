{"publicApplicationId":"com.coolapps.brokenhd","description":"This is a fun prank application. This application allows you to make your Touchpad appear as having a broken screen. This app resides as a WebOS app and can be tapped in any time from card view or launcher.\nIt does not change your wallpaper and does not take any resources when idle.\nUse it to pull a fast one on your girlfriend\/ boyfriend\/ spouse\/ kids (Oh look you broke it!)\nor as an excuse not to lend your Touchpad to someone (Sorry, the screen is broken).\nYou can choose from a set of ultra realistic 10 broken screen designs. \n(Slide\/ Flick image left\/ right to choose different broken screen design.)\nThe app is designed to be completely full-screen so no status bars are shown for a completely realistic broken Touchpad look. The other apps are still accessible with usual navigation.\nPlease note: the preview image screenshots shown here are altered in quality compared with originals included in the app.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/fbolly.comli.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/fbolly.comli.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 Coolapps Inc.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":3008890,"installSize":3833856,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T05:48:42.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.coolapps.brokenhd_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"com.coolapps.brokenhd\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_ss1copy.png","screenshot":"com.coolapps.brokenhd\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_ss1copy.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"thumbnail":"com.coolapps.brokenhd\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_ss2copy.png","screenshot":"com.coolapps.brokenhd\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_ss2copy.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"com.coolapps.brokenhd\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_ss3copy.png","screenshot":"com.coolapps.brokenhd\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_ss3copy.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"4":{"thumbnail":"com.coolapps.brokenhd\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_ss4copy.png","screenshot":"com.coolapps.brokenhd\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_ss4copy.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"5":{"thumbnail":"com.coolapps.brokenhd\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_ss5copy.png","screenshot":"com.coolapps.brokenhd\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_ss5copy.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
