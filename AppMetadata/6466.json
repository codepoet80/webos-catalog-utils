{"publicApplicationId":"org.voltar.noaa-metar","description":"METAR data is a form of weather data that comes in standardized human readable (really!) text. Pilots and meteorologists can glance at a page of METAR data and get an accurate 3D picture of the weather over huge regions and altitudes.\n\nNOAA helpfully puts METAR data on the web for free.\n\nThis app downloads the METAR and displays it in a simple list for easy reading.  It also includes a comprehensive METAR decoder that can be used for educational purposes.\n\nIf you've ever been curious about METAR or grew exhausted with FHM-1 (while somehow still enjoying METAR) this could be the app for you.","version":"0.9.25","versionNote":"","homeURL":"https:\/\/voltar.org\/","supportURL":"https:\/\/github.com\/jettero\/noaa-metar\/issues","custsupportemail":"noaa-metar-feedback@voltar.org","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Paul Miller","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":109688,"installSize":2064384,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-02-24T19:22:18.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"org.voltar.noaa-metar_0.9.25_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"6466\/en\/images\/1\/S\/metar.png","screenshot":"6466\/en\/images\/1\/L\/metar.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"6466\/en\/images\/2\/S\/decode.png","screenshot":"6466\/en\/images\/2\/L\/decode.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"6466\/en\/images\/3\/S\/airports.png","screenshot":"6466\/en\/images\/3\/L\/airports.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
