{"publicApplicationId":"com.geiger.flashlightplus","description":"Ever been trapped in the dark with no light?  The very sad truth is that on 9\/11 when the twin towers were hit power went out.  Those who escaped via the stairwells were thrust into near complete darkness with only their cellphones to light the way.  Flashlight Plus is they type of app everybody should have.  No complex preferences, no setup needed.  Just launch and tap the screen to turn on and off.  It may seem silly to have an app that turns your screen brilliant white.  Hopefully you will never need to use it.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.jaygeiger.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.jaygeiger.com","custsupportemail":"JayGeiger@JayGeiger.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 JayGeiger.com","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":5604,"installSize":1110534,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-07-20T19:25:46.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.geiger.flashlightplus_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2918\/en\/images\/1\/S\/SS.png","screenshot":"2918\/en\/images\/1\/L\/SS.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
