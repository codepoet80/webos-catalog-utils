{"publicApplicationId":"com.mikagika.date2datepro","description":"This app will not make you younger or better looking.  But it can tell you how many days old you are and how many Mondays you have endured in your life.  More importantly it can tell you what date is six months from now or how many days are left before the big project implementation.  With date2datePro you can calculate an end date given a start date and a number of days, weeks, or months.  Give date2datePro two dates and it will tell you how many days, weeks, months, and years are between those two dates.  Date2datePro will also show you the day of week, ordinal day number, ISO week number or days remaining in the year for any date.  Repeatedly adding a date interval (such as 28 days) is also very easy.  Date2datePro is the paid version of date2date that has no ads so more information fits on the screen.  It also has a nifty extra feature: the ability to save a target date or interval.  With that, every time you open the app you can immediately see what day is six months from today or how many days are left until the big project is due.  In v1.1 you can have list of multiple target dates that is saved as well.  If you need to do date interval calculations, date2date can help. *** v1.1 update includes launching calendar and save\/recall target dates","version":"1.1.00","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/date2date\/index.html","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/date2date\/index.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2010 mikagika, ltd.","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/date2date\/index.html","locale":null,"appSize":"42598","installSize":"42598","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.16","currency":"USD","filename":"com.mikagika.date2datepro_1.1.00_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"4475\/images\/1\/L\/date2datepro_shot1.png","screenshot":"4475\/images\/1\/L\/date2datepro_shot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"4475\/images\/2\/L\/date2datepro_shot2.png","screenshot":"4475\/images\/2\/L\/date2datepro_shot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"4475\/images\/3\/L\/date2datepro_shot3.png","screenshot":"4475\/images\/3\/L\/date2datepro_shot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"4475\/images\/4\/L\/date2datepro_shot4.png","screenshot":"4475\/images\/4\/L\/date2datepro_shot4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"4475\/images\/5\/L\/date2datepro_shot5.png","screenshot":"4475\/images\/5\/L\/date2datepro_shot5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
