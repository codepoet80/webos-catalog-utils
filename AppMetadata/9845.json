{"publicApplicationId":"com.explusalpha.mdemu","description":"Sega Genesis\/Mega Drive and Master System\/Mark III emulator based on Genesis Plus. Features very accurate emulation and is the first for WebOS. Runs well on a stock Pre with auto-frameskip. Performance varies by game and is similar to my free SNES app so Pixi users should use that as a reference. Install the \"Remove Tap Locator\" patch from Preware to improve performance when using touch controls. NOTE: The user must supply their own game ROMs and transfer them to the device's internal storage for use with this app.\n\nOther features include:\n* Very accurate sound emulation with high quality re-sampling\n* SegaCD emulation (beta)\n* 6-button controller support\n* Backup memory and save state support, auto-save and ten manual slots for save states. (NOTE: write access to \/media\/internal is required, some versions of WebOS 1.4.5 are broken and need to be re-installed via WebOS Doctor)\n* Supports ROM-based games in .bin and .smd formats, optionally in .zip files\n* Configurable on-screen multi-touch controls & keyboard support\n* iCade support (WebOS 2.0 or later)\n* Portrait\/Landscape orientation support\n\nFollow me on Twitter for updates about my apps:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/rakashazi\n\nVisit the homepage at explusalpha.com for more info, ports for other platforms, and my other apps.","version":"1.5.2","versionNote":"* Fix freeze opening Input options","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.explusalpha.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.explusalpha.com\/","custsupportemail":"info@explusalpha.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Robert Broglia","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1291716,"installSize":7405568,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-11-12T20:02:09.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":5.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.explusalpha.mdemu_1.5.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.explusalpha.mdemu\/1.5.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_IMG_0209-320.PNG","thumbnail":"com.explusalpha.mdemu\/1.5.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_IMG_0209-320.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.explusalpha.mdemu\/1.5.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_IMG_0208-320.PNG","thumbnail":"com.explusalpha.mdemu\/1.5.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_IMG_0208-320.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.explusalpha.mdemu\/1.5.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_IMG_0207-320.PNG","thumbnail":"com.explusalpha.mdemu\/1.5.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_IMG_0207-320.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
