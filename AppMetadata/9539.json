{"publicApplicationId":"com.machineworksnorthwest.duke3d","description":"Duke Nukem 3D\n\nThe PC classic lands on your Touchpad!\n\nTHE ORIGINAL KING OF ACTION RETURNS!\n\nWith dozens of Game of the Year awards under his belt, Duke remains the King of Action. Larger than life action is what Duke is all about, mixed with humor and innovative explosive action in this 20+ hour game.\n\nLos Angeles. Under attack by aliens intent on stealing our chicks for breeding. Duke Nukem springs into action dealing damage like only he can, making his \"insightful\" comments along the way. If you've never played a Duke game, this is your chance to see why he's been a fan favorite since 1991, with over 18 original Duke Nukem games since that time. Duke Nukem is not the typical faceless hero -- he's an in-your-face hero who has a personality that doesn't quit. Yes, it's a B-movie plot, but that's what makes it fun!\n\n\nCUSTOMIZED CONTROLS\n\nUse Dual Stick Controls or Drag\/Look! \n\nTHE PRESS HAS ITS SAY!\n\nMetacritic Player Rating: 9.4 of 10.\n\n\"It's the ultimate game for unleashing all your pent-up aggression. It is the most astonishing game we've laid our eyes on for ages! In fact, it makes pretty much every PC game we've ever seen - \"Doom\" included - like slightly dull. Honestly!\" -- PC Gamer \n\n\nDuke Nukem 3D (c)2009 3D Realms, Inc. All rights reserved.
