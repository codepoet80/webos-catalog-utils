{"publicApplicationId":"com.discipleskies.youarehere","description":"Where Am I ? is a powerful location tool that functions on multiple levels.  It includes two variations of current location reporting, allows for coordinate entry and even paints your trail on a map.  \n\nOne current location report shows your physical address in a beautifully displayed address scene, the second reports your coordinates and shows your position on a map. \n\nIf you know the coordinates of a position, you can enter them in any of the accepted formats for coordinate reporting and zoom-into that position on a street map, aerial view or a terrain diagram.  \n\nThe Trail-Painter is a wonderful extra feature & is great for helping you get in and out of unfamiliar territory.\n\nEmailing your location and a link showing your position on a map is as simple as entering the recipient's email address.\n\nThe app has multiple tap areas and is loaded with extras such as a coordinate translation tool enabling you to convert from one form of geographic coordinates to another. \n\n\"Show Me The World\" allows you to move the position marker to your tap position and reports the coordinates for the location you tapped.","version":"4.0.0","versionNote":"Email your location and a link showing your position on a map.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright Disciple Skies Software 2012","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":3788928,"installSize":6225920,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T09:56:31.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.89,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.discipleskies.youarehere_4.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.youarehere\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/320x480_320x480_1_where4.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.youarehere\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/320x480_75x112_1_where4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.youarehere\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_where3.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.youarehere\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_where3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.youarehere\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_whereScreen1.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.youarehere\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_whereScreen1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.youarehere\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_where8.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.youarehere\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_where8.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.youarehere\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_where2.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.youarehere\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_where2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
