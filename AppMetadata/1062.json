{"publicApplicationId":"com.vxsys.ctatranzit","description":"Tranzit is for seeing the real time arrival time of the Chicago Transit Authority buses. Note: This is only for the CTA buses in Chicago. The data is provided by the CTA using their BusTracker system. Save your favorite bus stops. For the price of one bus ride you can have up to the minute information on how long it will be before the next bus comes.  Searching of bus routes and stops is easy by just typing a few letters in the Pre or Pixi keyboard.\n\nWith this app you will be able to answer:\nHow long do I have to wait for the next bus?\nWhen should I leave so I don't wait long in the rain or cold?\nThe next bus is almost here, should I take it and save $10 on cab fare?\nOr, the next bus is too long, should I just take a cab?","version":"1.1.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/vxsys.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/vxsys.com","custsupportemail":"vxsyst@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"7732383535","copyright":"Copyright 2010 VX Systems","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":29128,"installSize":2501020,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-06-07T13:15:25.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.vxsys.ctatranzit_1.1.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"1062\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_ctatranzit_2011-06-06_191017.png","screenshot":"1062\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_ctatranzit_2011-06-06_191017.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"1062\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_ctatranzit_2011-06-06_191204.png","screenshot":"1062\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_ctatranzit_2011-06-06_191204.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"1062\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_ctatranzit_2011-06-06_191437.png","screenshot":"1062\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_ctatranzit_2011-06-06_191437.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
