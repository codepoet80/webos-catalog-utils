In order to actually \"hit\" the mole you not only have to whack it with your finger but you must answer a math question. Math-a-Mole Ultimate supports: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. You may select which one or more math operations to quiz on. The game starts with single digit math and ramps up to three digit arithmetic.","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"Pixi now has complete sound support with this release.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.somethingiknow.com\/Math-On-Phone","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.somethingiknow.com\/Math-On-Phone","custsupportemail":"mathonphone@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"3019562319","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Aaron Rosenzweig","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":835290,"installSize":3211264,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T19:03:04.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":2.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.drrosey.mathmoleultimate_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"8213\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot1.png","thumbnail":"8213\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"8213\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.png","thumbnail":"8213\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"8213\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot3.png","thumbnail":"8213\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"8213\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screenshot4.png","thumbnail":"8213\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screenshot4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"8213\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/screenshot5.png","thumbnail":"8213\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/screenshot5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
