{"publicApplicationId":"com.discipleskies.runningbuddy","description":"The perfect logging device for serious runners.  Get instantaneous speed, time elapsed, calorie consumption and distance.   An average speed reading is continuously updated and reported as you progress through your running course.   The odometer in this software has been tested in over 1200 miles of hikes and runs and is more accurate than the odometers in wrist-watch type running devices which means your reports are meaningful training tools.   Bonus features include a trail tracing for your current run and moment by moment GPS data reporting.  Each run is stored in a database which reports the date, distance and time for each run.  Data gathering can easily be paused and resumed as needed, ie for traffic lights.  If you run with your phone, this app is a must.  If you haven't been running with your phone, buy this app and you'll never leave for a run again without your Palm!","version":"4.0.0","versionNote":"Set default units as either U.S or Metric.  Default only needs to be set the first time you use the app.  Also improved performance of the Statistics Report.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 Disciple Skies Software","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":617834,"installSize":3932160,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T10:15:08.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.discipleskies.runningbuddy_4.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.runningbuddy\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_running2.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.runningbuddy\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_running2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.runningbuddy\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_running1.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.runningbuddy\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_running1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.runningbuddy\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_running3.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.runningbuddy\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_running3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.runningbuddy\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/320x480_320x480_ph_running4.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.runningbuddy\/4.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/320x480_75x112_ph_running4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
