Set in Bombay amid the turbulence of India\u2019s surge towards independence, Brahma\u2019s Dream tells the story of thirteen-year-old Mohini, an unforgettable character whose medical problems set her apart from the world around her, and give her a wisdom and special place in it. Mohini suffers from a rare form of anemia that gradually diminishes her physically but increases her understanding of life in a way incomprehensible to those who move more easily through it.  Under her kind, wry gaze, a family, a city, and a country convulse with idealism and hope. Through Mohini the reader encounters the extraordinary characters who live in her family home, Koleshwar Nivas. Vishnupant, Mohini\u2019s grandfather, is a forward-thinking professor of history who has devoted his life to making sense of India\u2019s past so that the country might fulfil the promise of its future. Keshav, Mohini\u2019s father, who, while embracing the prospect of independence, is eager to hold on to any progress made through British rule. But for both men Mohini is the centre of the universe, as she is for her devoted mother, Kamala, who has sacrificed the intimacy of her marriage to care for her child, and Vasanti, Mohini\u2019s aunt who, having lost the chance at a life beyond the confines of family, looks to her remarkable niece for comfort and understanding.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"5938390","installSize":"5938390","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"13.37","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.brahmasdreamanovel-9780385672559-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9557\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9557\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9557\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9557\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9557\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9557\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
