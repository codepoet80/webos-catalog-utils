{"publicApplicationId":"com.aclassapps.soldiertalk","description":"Soldier Talk is an app that translates whatever text you enter into phonetic alphabets used by the military. Throughout history, these alphabets have changed and with Soldier Talk you can go back in time. Current alphabets available are; \n\n- ICAO Alphabet (NATO)\n- Royal Navy 1914 - 1918\n- Signalese 1914 - 1918\n- Royal Air Force 1924 - 1942\n- Royal Air Force 1943 - 1956\n- United States 1941 - 1956\n- Morse Code\n\nOnce your text is translated, you have the options to share the results via email, text message, or even put your translated text into your Facebook status for your friends to see. We believe that Soldier Talk is not only for former and current military personnel, we believe that there are several other uses for Soldier Talk.\n\nYou can use Soldier Talk to send a coded message via text message or email. If you have a difficult name to spell or pronounce, you can use Soldier Talk to help others spell your name \ncorrectly for once. Example: Ice is India Charlie Echo in the current ICAO (NATO) alphabet.\n\nWe are sure there are several other uses for Soldier Talk. Please send us an email and let us know how you use Soldier Talk. Enjoy the App!\n\n**We are constantly working on keeping our apps up to date with all the latest technologies available & we will be constantly updating Soldier Talk with new features.**","version":"1.0.5","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.AclassApps.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.AclassApps.com\/apps\/soldiertalk\/index.htm","custsupportemail":"support@aclassapps.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 Aclass Apps","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":575778,"installSize":2424832,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T03:59:49.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.aclassapps.soldiertalk_1.0.5_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"6383\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_soldiertalk1.png","thumbnail":"6383\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_soldiertalk_2011-23-09_001846.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"6383\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_soldiertalk2.png","thumbnail":"6383\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_soldiertalk_2011-23-09_001928.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"6383\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_soldiertalk3.png","thumbnail":"6383\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_soldiertalk_2011-23-09_001941.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"6383\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_soldiertalk4fbook.png","thumbnail":"6383\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_soldiertalk_2011-23-09_001950.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"6383\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_soldiertalkLite3.png","thumbnail":"6383\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_soldiertalk_2011-23-09_002004.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
