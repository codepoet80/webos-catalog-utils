{"publicApplicationId":"com.tdaphneb.decode","description":"Decode is a code breaking game where the application generates a code four colours long using a set of six colours.  You have to figure out what the code is in eight or less guesses.\n\nOnce you have created your code it is checked and you will receive a response containing black and white pegs. A white peg indicates the correct coloured code ball in the correct position. A black peg indicates the correct coloured code ball in the wrong position. The order the pegs are displayed in does not match the order of the code you created.\n\nIf you guess the code correctly in eight or less guesses you win. If you run out of guesses you can always play again. Each game has a different code to break!\n\nGame statistics are saved and include games won during the session and games won all time.\n\nLandscape and portrait mode are supported.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TDaphneB","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TDaphneB","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"TDaphneB","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TDaphneB","locale":null,"appSize":"635076","installSize":"635076","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.15","currency":"USD","filename":"com.tdaphneb.decode_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"1000710\/icon\/S\/icon_1_0_0.png","screenshot":"1000710\/icon\/S\/icon_1_0_0.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
