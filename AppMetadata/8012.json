Rosamond Vincy\u2019s finishing school education is a foil to Dorothea Brooke\u2019s religiously-motivated quest for knowledge. Rosamond initially admires Lydgate for his exotic education, and his intellect. A similar dynamic is present in Dorothea and Casaubon\u2019s relationship, with Dorothea revering her new husband\u2019s intellect and eloquence. In both cases, however, the young wives\u2019 expectations of their husbands intellects are not reflected in reality.\n\n    Despite extreme erudition, Mr. Casaubon is afraid to publish because he believes that he must write a work that is utterly above criticism. In contrast, Lydgate at times arrogantly flaunts his knowledge, making enemies with his fellow physicians. He regards the residents of Middlemarch with a certain amount of contempt stemming from his belief that the townspeople are backwards and uninteresting. However, his education has not included tact and politicking, skills necessary in a small town but are seen by Lydgate as below him, the brilliant doctor.\n    (Summary \u2013 http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Middlemarch ) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
