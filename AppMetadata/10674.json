{"publicApplicationId":"com.minderleister.calculatorfinancial","description":"Compound Interest Calculator, Mortgage Amortization Calculator, Credit Card Repayment Calculator, Savings Plan Calculator & a super simple Percentages Tool \u2013 this app gives you five calculators in one bundle!\n\nThis app brings five tools to help you with common financial calculations. Use it as a little helper for quickly figuring out some numbers, or play with it to get a feel for the underlying math. This app is explicitly made for non-rocket-scientists!\n\nA few reasons why this app is way better than free stuff with similar names you find on the web:\n\n- You select what your inputs and outputs are. Most mortgage calculators ask for the mortgage value, interest rate and duration and calculate the monthly payment for you. This app puts you in the driver seat: Want to know the interest rate from value, APR and duration? Sure thing, just switch the output!\n-  Many people struggle with percentage calculations. We made the simplest percentage calculator in the world: Just enter two numbers from your problem and get the answers to all percentage calculations that involve them!\n- You\u2019re a visual thinker? All the tools come with a chart view to visualize the development of capital (or debt) based on the numbers you entered.\n- Not sure how something works? There is a detailed help file which covers not only how to use the calculator, but also much of the financial background info.\n\nA few things to note: Because math works the same everywhere, it works with any currency. We can\u2019t guarantee that the numbers computed here are a perfect representation of how you bank sees the world. This app is also available (at a discount) as a paid add-on to our free app \u201cCalculator++\u201d.\n\nPlease send feature requests, bug reports and feedback to calculator@minderleister.com. We are a friendly bunch and reply to every email, usually within a few hours. We also monitor app reviews but we cannot reply to those and can therefore not help you with any problems if you only leave your feedback there.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.minderleister.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.minderleister.com","custsupportemail":"calculator@minderleister.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Minderleister","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":823450,"installSize":2260992,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T04:26:32.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":2.49,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.minderleister.calculatorfinancial_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"10674\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_calculatorfinancial_2011-30-09_231718.png","screenshot":"10674\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_calculatorfinancial_2011-30-09_231718.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"thumbnail":"10674\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_calculatorfinancial_2011-30-09_231626.png","screenshot":"10674\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_calculatorfinancial_2011-30-09_231626.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"10674\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_calculatorfinancial_2011-30-09_231630.png","screenshot":"10674\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_calculatorfinancial_2011-30-09_231630.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"4":{"thumbnail":"10674\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_calculatorfinancial_2011-30-09_231633.png","screenshot":"10674\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_calculatorfinancial_2011-30-09_231633.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"5":{"thumbnail":"10674\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_calculatorfinancial_2011-30-09_232225.png","screenshot":"10674\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_calculatorfinancial_2011-30-09_232225.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
