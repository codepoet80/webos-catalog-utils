{"publicApplicationId":"com.randm.ftelnet","description":"fTelnet is a free, flash based telnet client optimized for use in connecting to bulletin board systems (BBSes).  Recently it has been updated to improve support for connecting to MUDs and MUSHes as well.\n\nIf you run into any problems while using this client, please click the Help button and then follow the link to the contact form to let me know.\n\nImportant usage notes:\n\n- If you are using the custom virtual keyboard instead of the TouchPad keyboard, double click the screen to improve input responsiveness.  (You'll know it has worked when you see a message saying 'Tap outside or pinch when finished')\n\n- If you are using the TouchPad keyboard (or a bluetooth keyboard), make sure you click the client window before you start typing, or your input may not be recognized.\n\n\nKey features include:\n\n- Pretty awesome terminal emulation (for BBSes).  Always willing to improve this too, so use the method mentioned above to contact me if you experience rendering problems.\n\n- Custom virtual keyboard that allows you to generate all the same keypress events that you would be able to on a desktop PC\n\n- Multiple simultaneous connections.  You can connect to each entry in your address book at the same time (only once per entry though), and switch back and forth with a single tap of the screen.\n\n- 1000 line scrollback buffer!  Use CTRL-UP to activate","version":"12.0701.01","versionNote":"- Added ability to hide custom virtual keyboard (useful for those with bluetooth keyboards)\n- Address book is no longer based on screen orientation, and is now always hidden when connecting to a server.  It can be recalled via the application menu\n- Selects the biggest font that will fit the screen (now that the address book is hidden, and both keyboards can be hidden, this allows for a much larger font that uses most of the screen)","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.randm.ca","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.ftelnet.ca\/enyo","custsupportemail":"enyo@ftelnet.ca","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2012 Rick Parrish, R&amp;M Software","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":170632,"installSize":720896,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-07-02T17:27:57.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.randm.ftelnet_12.0701.01_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.randm.ftelnet\/12.0701.01\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_screenshot-1-help.png","thumbnail":"com.randm.ftelnet\/12.0701.01\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_screenshot-1-help.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.randm.ftelnet\/12.0701.01\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_screenshot-2-landscape.png","thumbnail":"com.randm.ftelnet\/12.0701.01\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_screenshot-2-landscape.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"com.randm.ftelnet\/12.0701.01\/en\/images\/3\/S\/768x1024_320x480_2_screenshot-3-portrait.png","screenshot":"com.randm.ftelnet\/12.0701.01\/en\/images\/3\/L\/768x1024_768x1024_2_screenshot-3-portrait.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.randm.ftelnet\/12.0701.01\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_screenshot-4-starwars.png","thumbnail":"com.randm.ftelnet\/12.0701.01\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_screenshot-4-starwars.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
