{"publicApplicationId":"de.eding.dddtetris","description":"The ultimate game for Tetris\u00ae and Blockout\u00ae fans. Goal of the game is to complete a layer with blocks without gap which will cause the layer to disappear. With ongoing time this will become more and more difficult as the speed with wich the blocks fall will increase. After you achieved to complete 5 layers, the game level and hence the speed gets raised by one but by the same time the scoring per completed layer gets raised too. The scores are calculated from the number of blocks the number of completed layers and the game level. The game ends when your building touches the ceiling so that no more blocks can fall in.
