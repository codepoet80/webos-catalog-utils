{"publicApplicationId":"com.oceanhousemedia.bookwhatwasiscaredof","description":"Perfect for Halloween or any time of year, this story delivers a timeless message about fear and tolerance. The tale begins with a character who repeatedly meets up with an empty pair of pale-green pants. The character is initially afraid of the pants, which are able to stand on their own despite the lack of a wearer. However when he screams for help and the pants also start to cry, he realizes that \"They were just as scared as I!\"  Putting fear in the proper perspective, the empty pants become good friends with the character. \n\n?
