{"publicApplicationId":"de.arkandos.playlists","description":"New in 1.3.1: Import playlists with Windows - style file paths (in most cases)\n\nThe first and only Playlist App for webOS 2 allowing you to select more than 1 title per time using the new MediaBrowser!\n\nAre you also annoyed about the old file selector of previous versions or other playlist apps? You wonder, why you can only add one title at once and not select them from a list by artist or albums, like in the Stock Music app, even if you have an new webOS 2 device, like the HP Veer?\n\nTry this one ! It works seamlessly with all other music player apps, including the stock \"Music\" app syncronizing the created playlist with them. You can also import your existing m3u playlists, edit and store them again on your device. Even on webOS 1.4.5 devices, the app can load title informations of your music file, if you have corrupted or non-sense filenames.\n\nNote: This app requires an internet connection (normally < 2kb) to tranfer the playlists to your device. For the MediaBrowser function, you need webOS 2 or higher. Neither I nor HP are going to repay your money if the MediaBrowser does'nt work on your webOS 1.4.5 device.\n\nAnd like always: Please write an review & email me if you have problems.","version":"1.3.1","versionNote":"New in 1.3.1: Import playlists with Windows - Style filepaths","homeURL":"http:\/\/arkandos.de\/apps\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/arkandos.de\/apps\/playlists","custsupportemail":"yoschi@arkandos.de","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Joshua Reusch","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":150346,"installSize":2719744,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T23:08:15.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.49,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"de.arkandos.playlists_1.3.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"7601\/1.3.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_edit_playlist.png","thumbnail":"7601\/1.3.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_edit_playlist.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"7601\/1.3.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_playlists.png","thumbnail":"7601\/1.3.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_playlists.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"7601\/1.3.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_music_player_playlists.png","thumbnail":"7601\/1.3.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_music_player_playlists.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"7601\/1.3.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_media_browser.png","thumbnail":"7601\/1.3.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_media_browser.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"7601\/1.3.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_media_browser_albums.png","thumbnail":"7601\/1.3.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/ph_media_browser_albums.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
