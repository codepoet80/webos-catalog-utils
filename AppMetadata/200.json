{"publicApplicationId":"com.fivemicro.fmcaltrain","description":"FMCaltrain helps the user catch the Caltrain by showing them when the next two trains leave their station for their destination.  The user can also view the full schedule between the two stops to plan for a later trip.  FMCaltrain keeps its display up to date by using webOS alarms to periodically refresh the display of the next two trains.  Since webOS supports background applications, the user can keep FMCaltrain running at all times and be able to quickly switch to it whenever they need to know when the next Caltrain is coming.","version":"1.0.10","versionNote":"Corrected Caltrain timetable for Train #146 and #150.
