{"publicApplicationId":"com.berry.wendywwpro","description":"Wendy is my mother in law who has lost over 80 pounds using the original Weight Watchers \u00ae program.  She requested that I write a calculator to help her easily determine Point value on foods. Well.. here it is.\n\nI also show the actual point value.  For example: If 1 serving is 2 points, but the actual point count is 1.7, then 2 servings will come to 3 points (3.4). Good information to know.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Simple calculator to determine Weight Watchers \u00ae points\n- More features to come!\n\nThis application is not affiliated with Weight Watchers \u00ae.","version":"0.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.solidcoresolutions.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.solidcoresolutions.com","custsupportemail":"cavneb@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Eric Berry","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":9808,"installSize":524288,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T16:27:00.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.berry.wendywwpro_0.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"7708\/0.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ss1.png","thumbnail":"7708\/0.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ss1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"7708\/0.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ss2.png","thumbnail":"7708\/0.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ss2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
