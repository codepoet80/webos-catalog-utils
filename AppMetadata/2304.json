{"publicApplicationId":"com.firebrandforges.goodjew","description":"The Good Jew app is great for anyone interested in learning a little more about Jewish history and customs.  Good Jew focuses on breadth of knowledge, combining several app concepts into one neat package.  There is a news feed to the Jerusalem Post and Ha\u2019 Aretz, a Wisdom section with Pirkei Avot, a Prayer section with an overview of religious texts, currently 12 common blessings with Hebrew and English text, an overview of the holidays with associated blessings, a dynamic feed to weekly sermons (Parsha), and the Psalms of David (to be updated in their entirety), there\u2019s a glossary with hundreds of Yiddish terms and definitions and biographies of 40+ individuals from Biblical, Middle-Ages, and Modern eras.  There\u2019s also a calendar with all of the holidays listed out to 2019 in an easily accessible format. Not a bad package for about a buck.  Hope you enjoy!","version":"1.6.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.firebrandforges.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.firebrandforges.com","custsupportemail":"firebrandforges@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2010 Firebrand Forges","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":9030406,"installSize":26509312,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T22:09:53.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1OISmLk2o8M","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/1OISmLk2o8M\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.25,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.firebrandforges.goodjew_1.6.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"2304\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/cap1.png","thumbnail":"2304\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/cap1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"2304\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/cap5.PNG","thumbnail":"2304\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/cap5.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"2304\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/cap_multi3.png","thumbnail":"2304\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/cap_multi3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"2304\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/cap_multi2.png","thumbnail":"2304\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/cap_multi2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"2304\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/cap4.png","thumbnail":"2304\/1.6.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/cap4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
