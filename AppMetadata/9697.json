Slowly, through masses of dialog and ruminations by most of the characters, the complex plot unfolds into the usual Jamesian tangle of human relationships and subplots. The story takes shape as James unwraps each nuance of personality, each intricate piece of the puzzle. This latest novel demonstrates just how well James commands the English language and illustrates her considerable ability to craft and write a novel.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"6592192","installSize":"6592192","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"19.95","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.devicesanddesires-9780307400390-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9697\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9697\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9697\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9697\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9697\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9697\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
