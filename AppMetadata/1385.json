{"publicApplicationId":"com.gosyntactix.trial.packntrack","description":"A 7 Day Trial of our premier package tracking application!\n\n*Rated The Top Business\/Financial App of 2010 by PreCentral.net*\n\nPack \u2018n\u2019 Track is a shipment tracking application that supports Federal Express (FedEx), United Parcel Service (UPS), the United States Postal Service (USPS), and Deutsche Post (DHL). \n\nBegin by entering a tracking number from one of the supported couriers and Pack \u2018n\u2019 Track will begin tracking your package immediately. Don\u2019t worry about specifying which courier the number belongs to as Pack \u2018n\u2019 Track is smart enough to figure out which tracking numbers belong to each currier. \n\nPack \u2018n\u2019 Track is integrated into the WebOs environment so it still tracks your packages even if it is not open on your phone using minimal resources! Pack \u2018n\u2019 Track will also provides you with status change notifications each time the courier updates the status of you package. These notifications work just like your email notifications and are configurable so you can even turn them completely off or have Pack \u2018n\u2019 Track only notify you when the package has been delivered. \n\nIn addition to status notifications, Pack \u2018n\u2019 Track will also provide you with some additional details (subject to courier availability) about your package such as its estimated date of arrival, the package\u2019s weight, what service the package was shipped under, who signed for it once delivered, and where it was left at when delivered. It doesn\u2019t stop there though, we also provide tools that allow you to find a shipping location or look up and decode a zip code based on a provided address or your GPS location. We are working hard to bring you additional couriers, more detailed package info, and useful tools such as an estimated shipping cost calculator plus much much more! \n\nWE CURRENTLY HAVE LIMITED SUPPORT FOR MAILBOX INNOVATIONS & FEDEX SMARTPOST.","version":"1.1.33","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.gosyntactix.com\/products\/pack-n-track\/support\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.gosyntactix.com\/products\/pack-n-track\/support\/","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009 Syntactix LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.gosyntactix.com\/products\/pack-n-track\/support\/","locale":null,"appSize":"326074","installSize":"326074","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":0,"currency":"USD","filename":"com.gosyntactix.trial.packntrack_1.1.33_all.ipk","free":true,"images":[{"thumbnail":"1385\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_packntrack_2009-28-08_111544.png","screenshot":"1385\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_packntrack_2009-28-08_111544.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1385\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_packntrack_2009-28-08_105700.png","screenshot":"1385\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_packntrack_2009-28-08_105700.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1385\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_packntrack_2009-28-08_105808.png","screenshot":"1385\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_packntrack_2009-28-08_105808.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1385\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_packntrack_2009-28-08_111604.png","screenshot":"1385\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_packntrack_2009-28-08_111604.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1385\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_packntrack_2009-28-08_111056.png","screenshot":"1385\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_packntrack_2009-28-08_111056.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
