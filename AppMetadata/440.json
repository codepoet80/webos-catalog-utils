{"publicApplicationId":"com.shanerooni.quickwhack","description":"***UPDATE: Only a dropdown menu update per Palm's requirement. Also corrected an issue with the lives.*** QuickWhack is a whack-a-mole style tap the button before the light goes out game. The \"moles\" show up for a good amount of time, but as the levels increase you find them popping in and out a lot quicker. If you miss a mole, you lose a life. You are able to change the options of what level to start on, and how fast the timer depletes. Be smart, be careful... be quick!","version":"0.8.6","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.shanerooni.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.shanerooni.com","custsupportemail":"admin@shanerooni.com","custsupportphonenum":"484.654.2668","copyright":"Copyright 2009 Shanerooni, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":189802,"installSize":784423,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2009-12-08T22:48:10.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.shanerooni.quickwhack_0.8.6_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"440\/en\/images\/1\/S\/quickwhack_2009-18-11_125330.png","screenshot":"440\/en\/images\/1\/L\/quickwhack_2009-18-11_125330.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"440\/en\/images\/2\/S\/quickwhack_2009-18-11_125335.png","screenshot":"440\/en\/images\/2\/L\/quickwhack_2009-18-11_125335.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"440\/en\/images\/3\/S\/quickwhack_2009-18-11_125339.png","screenshot":"440\/en\/images\/3\/L\/quickwhack_2009-18-11_125339.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
