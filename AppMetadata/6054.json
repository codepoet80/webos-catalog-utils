{"publicApplicationId":"com.gelbintergalactic.remembeer","description":"Track and rate the beers you drink. No more trying to remember the name of that microbrew from last night, just check your log and see how you rated it! Remembeer was originally developed for the Android platform. Following that idea and with the permission of the developers, this Palm webOS version was created. There are some features which work a little differently but mostly because of the differences in the platforms. Where ever possible, the Palm webOS standards of look and feel have been followed.","version":"1.1.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/itfreely.blogspot.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/remembeer.info","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Gelb Intergalactic","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":650276,"installSize":6750208,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-11-23T20:55:07.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.gelbintergalactic.remembeer_1.1.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"6054\/en\/images\/1\/S\/Screen1.jpg","screenshot":"6054\/en\/images\/1\/L\/Screen1.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"6054\/en\/images\/2\/S\/Screen2.jpg","screenshot":"6054\/en\/images\/2\/L\/Screen2.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"6054\/en\/images\/3\/S\/Screen3.jpg","screenshot":"6054\/en\/images\/3\/L\/Screen3.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"6054\/en\/images\/4\/S\/Screen4.jpg","screenshot":"6054\/en\/images\/4\/L\/Screen4.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"6054\/en\/images\/5\/S\/Screen5.jpg","screenshot":"6054\/en\/images\/5\/L\/Screen5.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
