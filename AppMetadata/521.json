{"publicApplicationId":"com.invasivebamboo.periodictable","description":"This application is the premier reference for the Periodic Table of Elements on WebOS 3.0. Whether you are a physicist, chemist, student or enthusiast, this is the reference you need. \n\nThe purpose of the application is to provide a meaningful way to access and explore the Periodic Table. Using simple gestures to navigate, you can click on any element to see detailed information. The information provided includes Atomic Number, Name, Abbreviation, Atomic Weight, Category of Element, Valence, Melting and Boiling Points, Density, Atomic Radius, Covalent Radius and Electronegativity. \n\nThe color list provides multiple ways to display the data including the ability to color code each element based on Category, Boiling Points, Melting Points, Density, Valence, Atomic Radius, and Electronegativity levels.\n\nPeriodic Table stores its information locally for fast access with periodic updates to stay current.\n\nStandard and Landscape modes are fully supported. Each element also contains a link to its current localized Wikipedia page. \n\nGerman, French, Chinese, Italian and Spanish are also fully supported.\n\nKeep an eye out for up and coming additions to Periodic Table on our homepage!\n\n*Updated to include new elements","version":"2.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/invasivebamboo.com\/PeriodicTable.aspx","supportURL":"http:\/\/invasivebamboo.com\/Contact.aspx","custsupportemail":"support@invasivebamboo.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009-2012 Invasive Bamboo","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":224244,"installSize":3145728,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T06:49:19.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.invasivebamboo.periodictable_2.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.invasivebamboo.periodictable\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_Periodic1.jpg","thumbnail":"com.invasivebamboo.periodictable\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_Periodic1.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.invasivebamboo.periodictable\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_Periodic2.jpg","thumbnail":"com.invasivebamboo.periodictable\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_Periodic2.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.invasivebamboo.periodictable\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_Periodic3.jpg","thumbnail":"com.invasivebamboo.periodictable\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_Periodic3.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.invasivebamboo.periodictable\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_PeriodicChinese2.jpg","thumbnail":"com.invasivebamboo.periodictable\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_PeriodicChinese2.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
