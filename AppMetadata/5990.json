The sad news is that when the unthinkable happens and a pet life hangs in the balance most pet owners find that they are unable to afford the often staggering price of the treatments which can range from $3000-$10000 and some cases even more, and are forced to euthanize their pets anyway. It is in these instances that pet owners wish they had the foresight to purchase a pet health insurance policy. Read this book today and learn everything you need to know about Pet Health Care Insurance.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","custsupportemail":"support@appbookshop.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 AppBookShop","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":450498,"installSize":4128768,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T10:15:50.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":3.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.appbookshop.epub.pethealthcarehandbook_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"5990\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/icon-320x480.png","thumbnail":"5990\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/icon-320x480.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"5990\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/pethealthcarehandbook_2010-27-10_091639.png","thumbnail":"5990\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/pethealthcarehandbook_2010-27-10_091639.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"5990\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/pethealthcarehandbook_2010-27-10_091642.png","thumbnail":"5990\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/pethealthcarehandbook_2010-27-10_091642.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"5990\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/pethealthcarehandbook_2010-27-10_091646.png","thumbnail":"5990\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/pethealthcarehandbook_2010-27-10_091646.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
