{"publicApplicationId":"com.minderleister.percentageplusplus","description":"58% of the US population (56% in Europe) don't know how to calculate with percentages! This app won't make you a math wizard, but it will help you do the numbers whenever percentages are involved.\n\nThe app is very simple. Just enter two numbers. The app will offer solutions for all possible percentage computations involving the numbers you entered.\n\n\nExamples:\n\nA store advertises 30% off everything. The price on the label of a product says $19.99. \n--> Enter 30 and 19.99.\n--> The app answers: \"19.99 minus 30% is 13.99\"\nYou will pay $13.99 for the product after the discount has been applied.\n\nA carton of milk weighs 1100 grams. It contains 3% fat.\n--> Enter 1100 and 3.\n--> The app answers: \"3% of 1100 is 33\"\nThe carton of milk contains 33 grams of fat.\n\nSee the screenshots for other examples.\n\n\nThe app is free but contains ads. You should also check out our other apps including \"CalculatorPlusPlus\" and \"Scientific Calculator +-\".\n\nWe love to hear your feedback. Please email us any questions or suggestions to percentages@minderleister.com and we will reply within less than a day.
