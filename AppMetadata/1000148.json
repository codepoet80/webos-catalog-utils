{"publicApplicationId":"com.jackpot.doodlepad","description":"Doodle Pad is now new and improved. It is the one and only app for the Touchpad of its kind. While other developers have jumped ship, we remain committed to webOS and our fans, and continue add features. We put together an app like nothing else currently available.\n\n~Doodle Pad is a real hand writing, drawing, note taking, doodling app, optimized for the HP Touchpad.\n\n~Update 1.0.1 allows Naming and Saving your writing, drawing, etc. Your writing, drawing, etc. will be saved in the Doodles folder in Photos and Videos App of your Touchpad, under All Albums \/ Doodles. Also, photo import, updated controls a new command menu and also a Simple 16 Color Palette toggle it using the Palette button on the command button menu at the bottom.\n\t\t\n~For best results you can use a capacitive Stylus Pen just like with an iPad, writing with your finger is difficult and inaccurate, for now you can lean on a peice of paper or soft cloth.\n\n~Tap the Doodle Pad app menu located on the top left of the main screen for a list of options. You will find, About Doodle Pad, Help, Page Numbering On\/Off. \n\n~Controls will show or hide your Writing \/ Drawing \/ Recording \/ Pen Size \/ Color controls. You can choose different paper backgrounds, Pencil or Pen, Line, Rectangle, Circle, Rectangular Eraser, New Recording, Undo, Redo and Restart Recording.\n\t\t\n~A limitation inherent to all tablets is drag radius. The touchscreen needs you to move your finger a certain distance before it detects a drag as opposed to a tap. In a writing app, this can cause problems. Writing slower and larger can often help, particularly with the letters i, s and o. Do a web search for webOS Drag Radius for more info.\n\n~Please resist the temptation to leave a bad review, instead contact us for help \/ bug fixes \/ update requests. Simply e-mail support@jackpotideas.com anytime, we will be happy to help you or go to the Help and Support page by selecting Help from the Doodle Pad app menu on the top left of the main screen.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/jackpotideas.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/jackpotideas.com","custsupportemail":"support@jackpotideas.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 J@ckpot ideas, Inc.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":3112118,"installSize":5636096,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T08:11:11.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.jackpot.doodlepad_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"com.jackpot.doodlepad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_DoodlePad_NewandImproved.png","screenshot":"com.jackpot.doodlepad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_DoodlePad_NewandImproved.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"thumbnail":"com.jackpot.doodlepad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_DoodlePad_SaveAs.png","screenshot":"com.jackpot.doodlepad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_DoodlePad_SaveAs.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"thumbnail":"com.jackpot.doodlepad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_Doodle_Pad_Drawing_Lined.png","screenshot":"com.jackpot.doodlepad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_Doodle_Pad_Drawing_Lined.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"4":{"thumbnail":"com.jackpot.doodlepad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_Doodle_Pad_Drawing_Old.png","screenshot":"com.jackpot.doodlepad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_Doodle_Pad_Drawing_Old.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"5":{"thumbnail":"com.jackpot.doodlepad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_Doodle_Pad_Drawing_Yellow.png","screenshot":"com.jackpot.doodlepad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_Doodle_Pad_Drawing_Yellow.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
