{"publicApplicationId":"com.edmiller.uspeak4me","description":"(Available in ENGLISH ONLY)  \nuspeak4me can help a speech-impaired child communicate certain basic needs & desires.   Pressing one of the colorful icons causes the app to play a message such as \"I need to go to the bathroom\" or \"I want something to drink.\"  For eat, drink, and play requests, additional choices are presented; for example: \"I would like to have milk, please.\"\n\nAs the audio message is played, the same sentence is displayed on the screen.  Thus, it can also help the child learn to read.\n\nIn this first release, the choices are very basic, and generally reflect the needs of a particular child.  If you have any suggestions for phrases to be included in future updates, please send them to edmillerinfo@gmail.com","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/edmiller.info","supportURL":"http:\/\/edmiller.info","custsupportemail":"edmillerinfo@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Ed Miller","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":486264,"installSize":2326528,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T11:32:43.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.edmiller.uspeak4me_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"6407\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/usp1.png","thumbnail":"6407\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/usp1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"6407\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/usp2.png","thumbnail":"6407\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/usp2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"6407\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/usp3.png","thumbnail":"6407\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/usp3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"6407\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/usp4.png","thumbnail":"6407\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/usp4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"6407\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/usp5.png","thumbnail":"6407\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/usp5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
