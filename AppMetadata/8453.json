This app will blast sounds of such high frequency, it will bug human and animals alike. What makes this app different than other similar apps?

Thanks for being a loyal customer, Check out other apps from me as I shall be coming out with more soon. Please note: Higher frequencies may not be able to be played on your devices speaker and may require better sound equipment to produce.
