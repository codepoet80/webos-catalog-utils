{"publicApplicationId":"com.joezeffdesign.aboveandbeyond.kascht","description":"John Kascht is among the most prominent American caricature artists of the past half-century. His work elegantly straddles the line between cartooning and portraiture, and is part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery. \n\n\"Above & Beyond: John Kascht\" takes you inside his wondrous world, to a tiny farm in Pennsylvania where he lives with his wife \u2014 a beekeeper \u2014 and 500,000 honeybees. It is here that he deconstructs the world\u2019s most recognizeable faces and bodies with the meticulousness of a forensic examiner, and reassembles them in his own inimitable way to create iconic portraits that appear on magazines, theater posters, billboards and book covers. \n\nIn this app, the second in the acclaimed \u201cAbove & Beyond\u201d series, we present the story of John Kascht and his unforgettable work, told through his own words, caricatures, pencil sketches and other multimedia features.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.joezeffdesign.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/abovebeyondjohnkascht.com","custsupportemail":"studio@joezeffdesign.com","custsupportphonenum":"9736550501","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Joe Zeff Design, Inc.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":172032834,"installSize":221806592,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T04:05:52.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.joezeffdesign.aboveandbeyond.kascht_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10634\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_cover_hp.png","thumbnail":"10634\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_cover_hp.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10634\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_clinton_hp.png","thumbnail":"10634\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_clinton_hp.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"10634\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_clinton_sketch_hp.png","thumbnail":"10634\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_clinton_sketch_hp.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
