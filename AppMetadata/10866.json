{"publicApplicationId":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc","description":"This is a windows remote desktop client with sound. It allows remote control of a Windows PC or terminal server using the RDP protocol built into windows. Before downloading, please assure that your windows machine supports RDP. The professional\/ultimate and server versions of windows support the remote desktop feature while starter and home do not. \n\n*English only (including keyboard layout)*\n\nBoth on-screen and physical keyboards are supported. The on-screen keyboard can be switched between the webOS keyboard, and a simulated 104 key keyboard for ctrl\/alt\/function\/windows\/etc keystrokes. Three fingers tapped on the screen, activate the onscreen keyboard (unless a physical keyboard is attached). \n\nMouse controls are similarly simple. A single finger acts like the left mouse button, and tapping the screen is a click, touching and dragging is a left click drag, double clicking is simply double tapping. The right mouse button is handed by putting one finger on the screen and not moving it while using another finger to tap for a right mouse click or drag. Moving three fingers up\/down pans the display.\n\nThis is an active project, features being worked on include: win8 enhancements, a new connection manager, a replacement DNS resolver, and better panning. \n\nPlease use fully qualified host names or IPs when connecting to the windows machine. \n\nLastly, please check the application help menu, or send a support request before concluding something doesn't work. There are quite a number of options\/features only described by the help.\n\nThis is a GPL application based on rdesktop. By downloading it you accept the GPL license.","version":"0.3.2","versionNote":"Beta level support for the win8 beta.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.syllogithm.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.syllogithm.com\/webosrdp\/","custsupportemail":"support@syllogithm.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011, Jeremy Linton","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":958592,"installSize":5177344,"isEncrypted":true,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T08:48:45.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc_0.3.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc\/0.3.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_screen3.jpg","thumbnail":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc\/0.3.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_screen3.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc\/0.3.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_screen2.jpg","thumbnail":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc\/0.3.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_screen2.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc\/0.3.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_screen8.jpg","thumbnail":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc\/0.3.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_screen8.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc\/0.3.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_screen6.jpg","thumbnail":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc\/0.3.2\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_screen6.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc\/0.3.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_screen4.jpg","thumbnail":"com.syllogithm.webosrdpc\/0.3.2\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_screen4.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
