It is essentially a comedy contrasting the behaviour and attitudes of two visitors from Europe with those of their relatives living in the \u2018new\u2019 world of New England. The novel first appeared as a serial in The Atlantic Monthly for July-October, 1878. James made numerous minor revisions for the first book publication.
