{"publicApplicationId":"com.sidetop.constructioncalc","description":"Handy Construction Calculators will help you estimate many of your projects. These calculators will save you time by helping to estimate the quantity of materials needed. There are 20 calculators included: Asphalt, Aggregate, Board Foot, Brick, Concrete Square Forms, Concrete Round Forms, Drop Ceiling, Drywall, Fractions, Flooring, Framing, Insulation, OSB Sheeting, Paint, Roofing, Squaring (3-4-5), Sq Ft $ Cost, Tile. Also 5 handy lookup tables. Estimates the following: \n\nAggregate- tons required for a length, width, thickness and density.\n\nAsphalt- tons needed for a given area and thickness.\n\nBoard Foot- # of board feet for a length, width, thickness and quantity.\n\nBrick- # of bricks needed for an area based on type of brick being used.\n\nConrete- round and rectangular forms, cubic yards needed for a given area and thickness.\n\nDrop Ceiling- materials neededfor a width, length and anchor distance to ceiling.\n\nDrywall- materials needed for a given area and panel size used.\n\nFlooring - materials for a length, width and wastage %. \n\nFractions - perform arithmetic on feet, inches and fractions of inch. Convert Decimal to Fraction and Fraction to Decimal.\n\nFraming- studs and plates required for a given area based on stud spacing, number of window, door openings, corners.\n\nInsulation- number of rolls needed or quantity of blown insulation for a given area and roll size used.\n\nOSB Sheeting- number of 8x4 sheets required for a given area.\n\nPaint- gallons needed for a given area, wall type, # coats.\n\nRoofing -  materials for a length, width, pitch, bundle size, nail size.\n\nSquaring (3-4-5) - determine the diagonal length for a given length and width.\n\nSq Ft $ Cost - Total cost for a given length, width and $ cost per sq ft.\n\nTile-  # of field and border tile based on area size, tile size and orientation.\n\nv1.7.0 - Added $ cost per sq ft calculator.\n\nFuture calculators updated and enhanced based on user feedback.
