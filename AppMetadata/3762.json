{"publicApplicationId":"com.kingplus.highq","description":"High Q!\n\nThis game is based on the research Dr. J. Ridley Stroop who discovered the strange phenomenon now known as the \"Stroop Effect\" in the 1930's. In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of the reaction time of a task. When a word such as blue, green, red, etc. is printed in a color differing from the color expressed by the word's semantic value (e.g. the word \"red\" printed in blue ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the meaning of the word is congruent with its ink color.\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n\nChoose the color displayed, not the word! How many can you get before the time runs out?\n\n \n\nCompete against others for a Spot on our Top 10 High Scores List\n\nCan you make the list?","version":"1.0.3","versionNote":"Thanks for your feedback.
