{"publicApplicationId":"com.chickenfarm.facemorpher","description":"--Half Price for a limited time :)\nWhat's better than a photo of your loved ones?  A hilarious photo of their face stretched and squeezed into an awesomely weird shape. There are four built-in presets that will transform your face into different shapes.  But what fun is it to morph your face if you can't be the mad scientist behind it all?  Of course we thought of that!  In custom morph mode, you can draw the exact shape you want the face to take.  Want the a giant head? Check. Want a tiny mouth? Check.  Want tiny eyes and a huge head and a pointy head? Check. You get the idea :). You can take a new picture directly from Face Morpher or open and edit an existing picture in your photo album.  At this moment, saving photos is done by taking a screenshot.  This the number one priority for future updates and will be available as soon as its possible to implement this natively.  \nIf you like the app please let us know, by reviewing the app.  This helps us improve the app with your suggestions and keep food on the table :)","version":"1.2.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/chickenfarm.wordpress.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/chickenfarm.wordpress.com\/","custsupportemail":"chickenfarmsoftware@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"3522461495","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":832962,"installSize":10050756,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-07-18T09:31:41.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kt_KwwVuC6M","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Kt_KwwVuC6M\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.chickenfarm.facemorpher_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"1828\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_FaceMorpher1.png","screenshot":"1828\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_FaceMorpher1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"1828\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_FaceMorpher2.png","screenshot":"1828\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_FaceMorpher2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"1828\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_FaceMorpher3.png","screenshot":"1828\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_FaceMorpher3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"1828\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_FaceMorpher4.png","screenshot":"1828\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_FaceMorpher4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"1828\/en\/images\/5\/S\/ph_FaceMorpher5.png","screenshot":"1828\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_FaceMorpher5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
