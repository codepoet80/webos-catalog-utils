These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nPublished: 1911\n\nIn this light-hearted yet thought-provoking collection of articles, Bennett offers his thoughts on exercising your mind, organising your life, marriage, books and happiness, and other pocket philosophies.\n\nThe book stands the test of time, and much is still relevant and amusing \u2013 perhaps even more so, with nearly 100 years of hindsight, than when it was originally written.\n(Summary by Ruth Golding)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"292060","installSize":"292060","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.2","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.mentalefficiencyandotherhintstomenandwomenaudio_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7829\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_0.png","screenshot":"7829\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_0.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7829\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_0.png","screenshot":"7829\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_0.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
