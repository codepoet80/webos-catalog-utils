ORBITAL is a 1-thumb experience with a simple goal: score points by destroying orbs. A simple puzzle game for all with beautiful visual effects, it can be played in short sessions and is highly addictive. HOW FAR CAN YOU GO?\n\nGAMEPLAY You must shoot orbs into a grid with your cannon. The orb you fired will expand until it touches a wall or another orb. Each orb contains the number \u20183\u2019, which decreases by one every time it is hit. After 3 hits they explode and you earn a point. The game could be endless\u2026 There is just one condition: a shot orb must not touch the death line above the cannon! If it does, the game is over. A simple concept to rack your brains and nerves. ----------------------------------------- \nFEATURES \n- Single & Two player mode \n- 3 game modes: Gravity, Pure & Supernova \n- Beautiful particle effects ----------------------------------------- \nORBITAL is based on Gimme Friction Baby by Wouter Visser.","version":"1.0.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.bitforge.ch","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.orbital-game.com","custsupportemail":"support@orbital-game.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2009-2010 bitforge Ltd.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":28776166,"installSize":33325056,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-10-12T14:32:49.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vNqVvIbroRA","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/vNqVvIbroRA\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":2.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"ch.bitforge.orbital_1.0.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"5502\/en\/images\/1\/S\/orbital_screenshot_01.jpg","screenshot":"5502\/en\/images\/1\/L\/orbital_screenshot_01.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"5502\/en\/images\/2\/S\/orbital_screenshot_02.jpg","screenshot":"5502\/en\/images\/2\/L\/orbital_screenshot_02.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"5502\/en\/images\/3\/S\/orbital_screenshot_03.jpg","screenshot":"5502\/en\/images\/3\/L\/orbital_screenshot_03.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"5502\/en\/images\/4\/S\/orbital_screenshot_04.jpg","screenshot":"5502\/en\/images\/4\/L\/orbital_screenshot_04.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
