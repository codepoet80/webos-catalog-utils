{"publicApplicationId":"com.omastudios.sfclite","description":"PLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING\n\n---------------\nDISCLAIMER:\nThis app is under constant development to provide support for as many FTP servers as possible & I am not responsible for any damage that you cause to files, webOS devices, FTP servers, or any other electronic equipment used in conjunction with Simple FTP Client .\n---------------\n\nSimple FTP Client is the first FTP Client for webOS. It allows you to connect to any compatible FTP server (includes a number of UNIX and Windows FTP servers) and transfer files using an intuitive panel-based interface. It is built with speed in mind, so once you've added your first server, you can start transferring files in just a few taps. Transfers are just as fast as using a desktop client, with all the benefits of portability.\n\nThe Lite version is only intended to be used to test servers before purchasing the Pro version. The following features are exclusive to the Pro version:\n  *  Renaming and deleting of files, locally and remotely.\n  *  Local viewing of files, and built-in text editor.\n  *  Ability to attach files to emails.\n  *  Ability to add unlimited servers (Lite version is limited to one server).\n  *  Ability to queue an unlimited number of transfers (Lite version is limited to one queued transfer).\n---------------\nUPDATES\n\n1.0.0: Initial release.","version":"1.0.1","homeURL":"http:\/\/jnewc.net\/sfc\/forum","supportURL":"http:\/\/jnewc.net\/sfc\/forum","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 Jack Newcombe","licenseURL":"http:\/\/jnewc.net\/sfc\/forum","locale":null,"appSize":"99478","installSize":"99478","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":0,"currency":"USD","filename":"com.omastudios.sfclite_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":true,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9822\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_sfclite_2011-07-06_173259.png","screenshot":"9822\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_sfclite_2011-07-06_173259.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"9822\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_sfclite_2011-07-06_173608.png","screenshot":"9822\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_sfclite_2011-07-06_173608.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"9822\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_sfclite_2011-07-06_173708.png","screenshot":"9822\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_sfclite_2011-07-06_173708.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"9822\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_sfclite_2011-07-06_173510.png","screenshot":"9822\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_sfclite_2011-07-06_173510.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
