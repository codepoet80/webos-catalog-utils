You can quickly pinpoint your symptom and search through possible causes to learn more. From there, you can determine which facility (hospital ER, urgent care, retail clinic or physician) can most appropriately treat the cause. As you sit in the waiting room, you can access quality reports on the facility or doctor you are going to see and obtain more information about the possible treatments you may receive. iTriage truly is your lifeline to healthcare information when you need it the most.\n \nWhat People Are Saying About It\n\u201ciTriage saved my daughter\u2019s life when she broke out with severe hives. We looked it up we found out that what she had was Anaphylaxis. We rushed her to the R.R. and they told me that it was good that I acted fast, if not, our little girl would have died. Thank you iTriage and keep up the good work.\u201d G. F.\n\n\u201cI love iTriage! I have three young kids and it\u2019s so nice to have something on hand to do a little searching on. My father-in-law was recently admitted to the hospital with stroke-like symptoms but no signs of a stroke. While I sat in the waiting room, I did a little searching on iTriage, and found a possible diagnosis of a brain infection. Sure enough that\u2019s what he ended up with.\u201d \u2013 J.
