{"publicApplicationId":"com.discipleskies.mychristianhoroscopetrial","description":"The Trial version of this enlightening is NOT individualized to your birthday, birth time or birth location.  The full story behind the full feature app follows:\nJust as the stars heralded the birth of our Lord, Jesus Christ, they may predict the events of our own lives. Scholars have long believed that our destinies and the events that shape the courses of our lives are intimately tied to the celestial clock, or the arrangement and movement of the stars through the heavens. The sayings and proverbs of our prophets and Lord are linked, like their own lives, to the natural tides of the heavens and have prophetic meaning to each and every soul on God's earth. Your birthday is your anchor to the celestial clock and is a link to bible passages that foreshadow life events. Using sophisticated astronomy software, the positions of the stars prior to and including Jesus Christ's formidable years were determined with high precision. Scriptural clues were then used to establish a time frame for the teachings, statements and prophecies that appear in The Bible. Using the same software, astral positions for future dates are plotted and are compared to the historical star chart and scriptural text. This information is overlayed on the position of the stars at the time of your birth and produces an event projection that is specific for you!","version":"3.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Disciple Skies Software","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2241828,"installSize":5210112,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-10-24T00:20:54.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.discipleskies.mychristianhoroscopetrial_3.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10873\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_christian1.png","thumbnail":"10873\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_christian1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"10873\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_christian2.png","thumbnail":"10873\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_christian2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"10873\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_christian3.png","thumbnail":"10873\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_christian3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"10873\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_christian4.png","thumbnail":"10873\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_christian4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"10873\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_christian5.png","thumbnail":"10873\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/ph_christian5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
