{"publicApplicationId":"de.dev2day.keepassw.app","description":"KeePassW is currently more or less a KeePass 2.x viewer. Export your KeePass 2.x passwords as XML and import them into this app. KeePassW uses AES to secure your data, supports groups and is Open Source.\n\nThis app started as a research project and is published with the MIT license. Get the sources at dev2day.de\/git.\n\nPassword how-to: Just enter your new password at the first start of the app and then import your data. Everything is encrypted with the provided password and the encrypted data is stored on the device. The password is \"set\" if you actually have groups\/keys. Subsequent starts of the app try to decrypt your data with the provided password.\n\nYou cannot change the password. But you can entirely clear the KeePassW data using its main menu. Now restart the app, enter a new password and reimport your data to use the new password.","version":"0.2.5","versionNote":"This new version is just a minor update and adds the ability to show users and passwords in plaintext.","homeURL":"http:\/\/dev2day.de","supportURL":"http:\/\/dev2day.de\/typo3\/index.php?id=111","custsupportemail":"jan.friedrich@dev2day.de","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 Jan Friedrich","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":25908,"installSize":786432,"isEncrypted":true,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-10-11T19:02:52.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"de.dev2day.keepassw.app_0.2.5_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10404\/0.2.5\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_image1.png","thumbnail":"10404\/0.2.5\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_image1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10404\/0.2.5\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_image2.png","thumbnail":"10404\/0.2.5\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_image2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"10404\/0.2.5\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_image3.png","thumbnail":"10404\/0.2.5\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_image3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
