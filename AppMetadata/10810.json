{"publicApplicationId":"learntowrite.org.gdesign","description":"Learn To Write is the first and only writing application which teaches children how to write in an environment that is as close as it gets to real, live paper.\n\nSimply enter a practice word for your child and hit \"GO\" to see it displayed on the virtual paper. From there your child can practice writing that word as often as they want!\n\nBecause this is a writing application, a stylus is encouraged, but not required.","version":"1.0.5","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/gdesign.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/gdesign.org","custsupportemail":"info@gdesign.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 GDESIGN, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":169448,"installSize":655360,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T04:52:10.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.5,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"learntowrite.org.gdesign_1.0.5_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"10810\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_gdesign_2011-12-10_142837.png","screenshot":"10810\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_gdesign_2011-12-10_142837.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10810\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_gdesign_2011-12-10_142753.png","thumbnail":"10810\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_gdesign_2011-12-10_142753.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"10810\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_gdesign_2011-12-10_142734.png","thumbnail":"10810\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_gdesign_2011-12-10_142734.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
