Forty-three years ago, Ian Fleming wrote his last great 007 adventure. Now, in \"Devil May Care\", the world's most iconic spy returns in a Cold War story spanning the world's exotic locations. By invitation of the Fleming estate to mark the centenary of his birth, acclaimed novelist Sebastian Faulks picks up where Fleming left off, writing a tour de force that will electrify every James Bond fan. A fitting tribute to the Bond tradition, \"Devil May Care\" stands on its own as a triumph of witty prose and plenty of double-0 action.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"5754304","installSize":"5754304","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"10.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.devilmaycarethenewjamesbondnov-9780307373328-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9698\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9698\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9698\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9698\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9698\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9698\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
