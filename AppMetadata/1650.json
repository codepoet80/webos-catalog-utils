{"publicApplicationId":"com.atomic-labs.spiritorb","description":"The Spirit Orb currently only responds in English.\n\nForged and programmed outside of the enigmatic hills of Stonehenge by 665 necromancers (one called in sick that day). The Spirit Orb utilizes both technology and the realm of mysticism to bring forth answers from the great beyond. It will answer the questions that you dare to ask revealing knowledge that will be unquestionably accurate. Individual results may vary. \n\nWe at Atomic-Labs take our users' requests, and those of the Elder Gods, seriously. In response to your comments, you now will also be able to hear and feel the voices from beyond. The Spirit Orb will also now respond to more mundane questions with simple answers such as Yes or No, or Heads or Tails. You can also choose between the normal spherical orb or the new skull orb when waiting to hear your answers from beyond. Now let the spirit voices guide you!\n\nA quick little informational update: you will need to update to your phone to at least version 1.4.0 of webOS in order to take full advantage of the Spirit Orb. We apologize for any inconvenience.","version":"1.5.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.atomic-labs.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.atomic-labs.com","custsupportemail":"support@atomic-labs.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Atomic-Labs.com","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2126240,"installSize":4390912,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T06:45:57.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.atomic-labs.spiritorb_1.5.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"1650\/1.5.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/spiritorb1.png","thumbnail":"1650\/1.5.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/spiritorb1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"1650\/1.5.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/spiritorb2.png","thumbnail":"1650\/1.5.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/spiritorb2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"1650\/1.5.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/spiritorb3.png","thumbnail":"1650\/1.5.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/spiritorb3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"1650\/1.5.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/spiritorb4.png","thumbnail":"1650\/1.5.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/spiritorb4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"1650\/1.5.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/newskull.jpg","thumbnail":"1650\/1.5.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/newskull.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
