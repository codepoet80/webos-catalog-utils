{"publicApplicationId":"com.wog.cardkeeper","description":"Store your store cards and free your keys! Maintain shopping lists and have quick access to the calculator! WOG Card Keeper lets you put your shopper cards on your phone! Have heavy items in your cart? Put the barcode into the generator! Want to price check an item without carrying it around? Punch in the barcode and scan your phone! You can simply put in the bar code numbers and it will be generated for you, you choose the match from the list, then it's saved. You also have the option to upload a scanned image to the application through the Card Keeper website. No more digging around for your keys, or for a shopper card in your wallet or purse. These don't get dirty or rub off. Testing shows that the bar codes on the phones work only with HAND SCANNERS! A hand scanner IS NOT a flat bed style scanner! Keep that in mind when you're checking out! Also, the camera on the Palm phones does not auto focus, so we cannot take a decent picture of your barcode and scan it in - I have the software knowledge - the hardware will not work - so PLEASE don't downgrade the app based on limitations beyond our control! If you email me the type matches for your local stores, I can begin adding those to a drop down for ease of adding shopper cards (i.e. email me Kroger is a standard UPC).","version":"1.1.3","homeURL":"http:\/\/cardkeeper.webosgroup.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/cardkeeper.webosgroup.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009 WebOS Group","licenseURL":"http:\/\/cardkeeper.webosgroup.com","locale":null,"appSize":"139186","installSize":"139186","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.98","currency":"USD","filename":"com.wog.cardkeeper_1.1.3_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"516\/images\/1\/L\/cardkeeper_2010-13-04_112409.png","screenshot":"516\/images\/1\/L\/cardkeeper_2010-13-04_112409.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"516\/images\/2\/L\/cardkeeper_2009-18-11_135656.png","screenshot":"516\/images\/2\/L\/cardkeeper_2009-18-11_135656.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"516\/images\/3\/L\/cardkeeper_2010-30-03_100927.png","screenshot":"516\/images\/3\/L\/cardkeeper_2010-30-03_100927.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"516\/images\/4\/L\/cardkeeper_2010-30-03_100957.png","screenshot":"516\/images\/4\/L\/cardkeeper_2010-30-03_100957.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"516\/images\/5\/L\/cardkeeper_2010-30-03_101008.png","screenshot":"516\/images\/5\/L\/cardkeeper_2010-30-03_101008.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
