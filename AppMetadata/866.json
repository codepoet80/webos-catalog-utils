{"publicApplicationId":"com.orgorganization.app.tminus","description":"T Minus is perfect for anyone who wants an easy to use, customizable, functional and flexible timer application. It allows you to pause, resume, stop, start and reset the countdown easily. There is also looping functionality which will allow you to continuously repeat a countdown. Starting times (durations) can be easily set using the Set Duration picker or by using 8 customizable Quick Durations. A default starting duration can be configured to have the countdown start as soon as the application is opened. Quickly modify the current duration by tapping the Increment\/Decrement buttons which have customizable values, or flick using varying configurable velocities at the Hours, Minutes and Seconds values on the main screen, even as the countdown is running. As the countdown nears the end, a notification will display to alert you that the countdown is nearing zero. An optional audible tone and vibration occurs when zero is reached. The main countdown screen can be displayed using one of multiple themes. In addition to the main screen, a Dashboard will become available when the main screen is minimized or the device is locked. The Dashboard will show the remaining duration, starting duration and Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, Reset and Loop controls. All of the controls are fully functional from the lock screen. v1.0.1 CHANGES: (1) Added the ability to use a ringtone for the countdown end notification.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.orgorganization.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.orgorganization.com\/tminus.html","custsupportemail":"tminussupport@orgorganization.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2010 OrgOrganization","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2778390,"installSize":11477870,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T00:12:26.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.orgorganization.app.tminus_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"866\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screen-1.jpg","thumbnail":"866\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screen-1.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"866\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screen-2.jpg","thumbnail":"866\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screen-2.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"866\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screen-3.jpg","thumbnail":"866\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screen-3.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"866\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screen-4.jpg","thumbnail":"866\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screen-4.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"866\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/screen-5.jpg","thumbnail":"866\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/screen-5.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
