{"publicApplicationId":"com.appjammers.apps.myip","description":"Updated for webOS 2.x compatibility. MyIP is a network connection utility that shows your IP address and other connection information for each of the network interfaces including WIFI,  and Phone connections.  Clicking on each IP address copies that address to the clipboard for pasting into another application.  For WIFI connections, your public IP (if you are behind a router\/firewall) is also displayed if available.  When MyIP is running, clicking on any of the other connection information other than the IP address will launch the appropriate application to manage the settings.","version":"0.9.5","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.appjammers.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.appjammers.com\/m\/help\/myip\/","custsupportemail":"help@appjammers.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 AppJammers, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":20988,"installSize":884736,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T19:48:42.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.appjammers.apps.myip_0.9.5_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"330\/0.9.5\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_myip.png","thumbnail":"330\/0.9.5\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_myip.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"330\/0.9.5\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_myip.png","thumbnail":"330\/0.9.5\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_myip.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"330\/0.9.5\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_myip.png","thumbnail":"330\/0.9.5\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_myip.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
