Under the rules of this society, \u201cbeing things\u201d is better than \u201cdoing things\u201d and reputation and outward appearances come at the exclusion of everything else. In this Gilded Age, when America\u2019s expansion and increased industrialism produce a group of newly wealthy robber barons and financiers, the patient, time-honored values of the old ruling class, and century, are giving way to the expediencies of the new. Caught at this cusp, a triangle of lovers, who must choose between the expectations of family and society, and the deepest yearnings of the heart.\n\n(Excerpt of a summary by Brenda Dayne) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"280018","installSize":"280018","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.2","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.theageofinnocenceaudio_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7347\/images\/1\/L\/theageofinnocence1.png","screenshot":"7347\/images\/1\/L\/theageofinnocence1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7347\/images\/2\/L\/theageofinnocence2.png","screenshot":"7347\/images\/2\/L\/theageofinnocence2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
