{"publicApplicationId":"com.appible.annakarenina","description":"It is the story of a fashionable married woman, Anna Karenina, who arrives in St Petersberg to meet Stepan Arkadyevitch but meets with him another man. This man, Count Vronsky, is strangely attracted to Anna from the outset and she begins to feel for him too. Anna recalls her cold-blooded and cynical husband who is twenty years her senior. He never shows her any affection and considers her to be a trophy. The Count contrives to meet Anna again through his friendship with Stepan, with whom Anna is residing. The novel then follows this liaison as it begin and then ends horribly as Anna\u2019s husband Karenin finds out about the affair. Anna is brought down by others\u2019 passions and power over her and she is driven, after many twists and turns in her fortunes and those of her lovers, to throw herself under the wheels of a train. It is one of the most famous suicides in literary history but to know of its inevitability only makes the tragedy of Anna\u2019s life more cathartic and sad. \"Bibliomania.com\"","version":"1.5.4","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/a\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"1279196","installSize":"1279196","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"0.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.annakarenina_1.5.4_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"1974\/de\/images\/1\/L\/1karenina.png","screenshot":"1974\/de\/images\/1\/L\/1karenina.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1974\/de\/images\/2\/L\/2karenina.png","screenshot":"1974\/de\/images\/2\/L\/2karenina.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1974\/de\/images\/3\/L\/3karenina.png","screenshot":"1974\/de\/images\/3\/L\/3karenina.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"1974\/de\/images\/4\/L\/4karenina.png","screenshot":"1974\/de\/images\/4\/L\/4karenina.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
