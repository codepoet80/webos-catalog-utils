{"publicApplicationId":"com.mikagika.fran","description":"Looking for a friend to give you encouragement or a laugh?  Someone with positive (although possibly nonsensical) things to say?  Are you fortunate to have such a friend but sometimes she's too busy to talk with you?  Of course!  Fran the fill-in friend can, well, fill in for this friend.  (How's that for a well-named app?)  She may want to share a bit about herself or tell you what she has just heard.  Often she wants to encourage you & lift your spirits.\n\n***New in this edition:  Hundreds of additional words and sentences.  Nixed many of the less interesting sentences.***\n\nFran has oodles of compliments\/gossip\/bits of info to tell you.  She also has lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs to fill in her sentences.  When she puts the two together, the result may be complimentary, kind, funny, odd or nonsensical.  No guarantees here.  \n\nDo you know what you'd like to hear but no one says it?  Offer Fran a word or two and she will fill them into her next sentence, albeit perhaps not in the way you expected!  Fran is a strange conversationalist but she means well.  And when you're done with your \u201ctalk\u201d, you can leave with no hurt feelings.  \n\nPlease note that Fran has not been taught negative or off-color words, giving her a kid-safe vocabulary.  Of course, if you tell her to use negative or off-color words in her sentence she will, but don't blame that on her.  Also, Fran won't outright insult you unless you tell her to.","version":"1.3.00","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/fillinfriend\/index.html","custsupportemail":"help@mikagika.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2010 mikagika, ltd.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":75910,"installSize":1540096,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-02-02T07:49:17.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mikagika.fran_1.3.00_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2830\/en\/images\/1\/S\/fran_shot1.png","screenshot":"2830\/en\/images\/1\/L\/fran_shot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"2830\/en\/images\/2\/S\/fran_shot2.png","screenshot":"2830\/en\/images\/2\/L\/fran_shot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"2830\/en\/images\/3\/S\/fran_shot3.png","screenshot":"2830\/en\/images\/3\/L\/fran_shot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"2830\/en\/images\/4\/S\/fran_shot4.png","screenshot":"2830\/en\/images\/4\/L\/fran_shot4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"2830\/en\/images\/5\/S\/fran_shot5.png","screenshot":"2830\/en\/images\/5\/L\/fran_shot5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
