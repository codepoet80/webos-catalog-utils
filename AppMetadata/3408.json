{"publicApplicationId":"com.diceapps.webos.stoptimerplus","description":"The StopTimer Plus now has an on-screen number pad for easier countdown input. You can close the window and the app will run strictly in the dashboard. The app is ad free. Stop the phone from dimming or going black by setting the \"Save Battery\" preference to \"yes\". You even have a countdown history popup to select from your previous countdowns.\n\nAs usual, you can use it as a regular stopwatch or as a countdown timer that will alert you with your choice of ringtone or song audio alert, and\/or vibrate. You can set how often a update banner message is displayed and if it makes a sound. Run in normal portrait mode or zoom in with landscape mode. Switch between themes, hide the split button and more.
