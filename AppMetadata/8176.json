{"publicApplicationId":"com.davidjarvismd.bishopscore","description":"Runs full-screen on all webOS devices, including Pre3. \n\nBishop Score is a tool for physicians, midwives, and OB nurses to calculate the chance of labor induction being successful by cervical exam characteristics.  It uses both the classic and modified measurements.  I designed it to use in my own practice and to start learning WebOS programming.  I could not have done it without Dr Teh's (PalmDoc) gracious support and examples!\nChanges:\nv1.1.4 - now runs in full-screen on Touchpad, so can rotate.  Also, baby in the app is now Native American colored, as that is who I deliver, mostly, and they are just so darn cute!\nv1.1.3- Touchpad compatibility, better Veer compatibility, and minor updates to Interpretation.\nv1.1.2 - Donation button added to About page, new support web page link, and misc minor bug fixes, and now assigned to the References - Medical category in App Catalog \nv1.1.1 - Now Pixi and Veer compatible.  Also minor bug fixes and added buttons to return to main screen. \nv 1.0.0 - I cleaned up the support scenes.  Not as fancy as I would like, but a good start...\n\n\nv0.0.2-0.0.4 were in Web Distribution.","version":"1.1.4","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/bboodoc.blogspot.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/forums.precentral.net\/webos-medical-apps\/278227-bishop-score-app-released.html","custsupportemail":"djarvis86@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 David Jarvis","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":123546,"installSize":1376256,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-09-07T03:09:12.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.davidjarvismd.bishopscore_1.1.4_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.davidjarvismd.bishopscore\/1.1.4\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_TouchpadBishScores (3).png","thumbnail":"com.davidjarvismd.bishopscore\/1.1.4\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_TouchpadBishScores (3).png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.davidjarvismd.bishopscore\/1.1.4\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_TouchpadBishScores (4).png","thumbnail":"com.davidjarvismd.bishopscore\/1.1.4\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_TouchpadBishScores (4).png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.davidjarvismd.bishopscore\/1.1.4\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_TouchpadBishScores (1).png","thumbnail":"com.davidjarvismd.bishopscore\/1.1.4\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_TouchpadBishScores (1).png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.davidjarvismd.bishopscore\/1.1.4\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_ScreenCaptureBishScore002.png","thumbnail":"com.davidjarvismd.bishopscore\/1.1.4\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_ScreenCaptureBishScore002.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
