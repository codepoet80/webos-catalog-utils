Now this card game was specially optimized for Palm Pre\/Palm Pixi\/HP Veer\/Pre3 screens with a large and eye-friendly card set.\n\nEnjoy smooth and intuitive gameplay, focusing on the game and not on the control.\n\nFeatures:\n\t* Large and eye friendly card set\n\t* Intuitive card movement system\n\t* Unlimited undo\n\t* Automatic saves your game during an income phone call or SMS\n\t* Optional timed game for Free Cell addicts\n\n*** Rules ***\n\nNumber of Decks: 1 (52 cards)\n\nLayout: At the beginning you will see the four open cells , four foundations to the right of the cells, and below them there are the eight columns of the tableau, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six.\n\nObject: The goal of the game is to use all the cards to complete the four suit foundations, moving Aces as they appear. You have to build up each one in suit from Ace to King (A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K).\n\nPlay: As the game begins, FreeCell Solitaire deals all 52 cards into the tableau. You have to move all the cards from the stock to the 4 suit foundations. Each one foundation should be built upward, in sequence from Ace to King. You are allowed to put to an empty foundation only Aces. Then you should add there only the following higher card, and only of the same suit.\n\nCards within the tableau should be build in descending sequence of alternating colors. For instance, if there is 6 of red suit, you can put on it only 5 of black suit. You can put to foundation the lowest card of a sequence, as well as put a sequence of cards as a unit from one pile to another.\n\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\n\nThe game will end in two cases: a) no more moves left - so you've lost; b) all foundations are filled - and you've won!\n\nJust find a minute to forget your day-to-day worries and play!","version":"1.2.1","versionNote":"- HP Pre3 support\n- some small bugfixes","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.softick.com\/company.html","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.softick.com\/support.html","custsupportemail":"support@softick.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright Softick Ltd 2010-2011","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2628434,"installSize":5144576,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-12-19T08:41:46.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.softick.app.freecell_1.2.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.softick.app.freecell\/1.2.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_screenshot1.png","thumbnail":"com.softick.app.freecell\/1.2.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_ph_screenshot1.png","orientation":"L","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.softick.app.freecell\/1.2.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_screenshot2.png","thumbnail":"com.softick.app.freecell\/1.2.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_ph_screenshot2.png","orientation":"L","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.softick.app.freecell\/1.2.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_screenshot3.png","thumbnail":"com.softick.app.freecell\/1.2.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_ph_screenshot3.png","orientation":"L","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.softick.app.freecell\/1.2.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_screenshot4.png","thumbnail":"com.softick.app.freecell\/1.2.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/conv_ph_screenshot4.png","orientation":"L","device":"P"}}}
