This story transports the listener from the fine air and freedom of the mountaintop to the confines of Frankfurt, back to the peaks again, bounding in flowered fields with goats at your heels and sky utterly surrounding you.\n\n    We meet Heidi when she is 5, led up the mountain by her aunt who has raised the orphan but must leave now for a position in Frankfurt. In a mountain cottage overlooking the valley is Heidi\u2019s grandfather, and there with him the girl\u2019s sweet, free nature expands with the vista. The author\u2019s voice is straightforward, and so is our reader\u2019s, with the child\u2019s wonder, devotion, and sometimes humorous good intentions. When Heidi is taken from the mountains and nearly doesn\u2019t make it back again, the most humorous as well as most heart-wringing scenes occur. All she learns during her absence from the mountain she brings back as seeds that will grow to benefit everyone around her.
