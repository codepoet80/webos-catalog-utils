{"publicApplicationId":"com.jimlong.recoverytools","description":"A set of tools designed to keep you active in your own recovery...\n\nThis app was designed with men & women who follow the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous in mind. Alanon, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, SLAA, and any 12 Step based programs will also find this tool to be extremely helpful.\n\nUse this tool primarily as an aid in completing your Daily Review. I've also added in some bonus items to help you along your journey.\n\nIncluded in the app: \n\t- The ability to store contact names\/numbers and launch from within the tool. \n\t- An archive that will allow you review all entries made into your \"review\" journal. \n\t- Quick reference to selected readings common in 12 Step meetings (\"Upon Awakening\", and \"When we retire at night\"). \n\t- Items from your review are formatted into a \"To-Do\" list (..when you need to make amends!!) \n\t- The ability to clear and delete all data from the app.\n\t- A table view of inventory items to help see developing trends (\"The Ugly Truth!\").\n\t- A pre-formatted gratitude list created from items you enter into your daily review.\n\nFeedback is always welcomed - jimzone11@yahoo.com\nEnjoy!","version":"2.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/jimlong.dyndns-free.com\/index.htm","supportURL":"http:\/\/jimlong.dyndns-free.com\/index.htm","custsupportemail":"jimr.long@att.net","custsupportphonenum":"2147705205","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":268100,"installSize":983040,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T23:30:16.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.jimlong.recoverytools_2.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"8925\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_recoverytools_2011-21-06_160548.png","thumbnail":"8925\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_recoverytools_2011-21-06_160548.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"8925\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_recoverytools_2011-21-06_160912.png","thumbnail":"8925\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_recoverytools_2011-21-06_160912.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"8925\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_recoverytools_2011-21-06_160957.png","thumbnail":"8925\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_recoverytools_2011-21-06_160957.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"8925\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_recoverytools_2011-21-06_161008.png","thumbnail":"8925\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_recoverytools_2011-21-06_161008.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
