{"publicApplicationId":"org.khanacademy","description":"The Khan Academy is an organization on a mission. We're a not-for-profit with the goal of changing education for the better by providing a free world-class education to anyone, anywhere.\n\nAll of the site's resources are available to anyone. It doesn't matter if you are a student, teacher, home-schooler, principal, adult returning to the classroom after 20 years, or a friendly alien just trying to get a leg up in earthly biology. The Khan Academy's materials and resources are available to you completely free of charge.\n\nOur library of more than 2,700 videos covers K-12 math, science topics such as biology, chemistry and physics, and even reaches into the humanities with playlists on finance and history. Each video is a digestible chunk, approximately 10 minutes long, and the app is specifically designed for viewing on HP TouchPad.","version":"1.3.18","versionNote":"New features include:\n- Account Login using Google and Facebook\n- Bookmark\n- Badges\n- Account History\n- Video History\n- Enhancement to user interface","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/about\/the-team","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"\u00a9 2012 Khan Academy\u2122","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":883110,"installSize":3702784,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-02-17T19:13:42.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"org.khanacademy_1.3.18_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"org.khanacademy\/1.3.18\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_Home.png","thumbnail":"org.khanacademy\/1.3.18\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_Home.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"org.khanacademy\/1.3.18\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_AccountLogin.png","thumbnail":"org.khanacademy\/1.3.18\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_AccountLogin.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"org.khanacademy\/1.3.18\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_AccountHistory.png","thumbnail":"org.khanacademy\/1.3.18\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_AccountHistory.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"org.khanacademy\/1.3.18\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_Badges1.png","thumbnail":"org.khanacademy\/1.3.18\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_Badges1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"org.khanacademy\/1.3.18\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_VideoSelector.png","thumbnail":"org.khanacademy\/1.3.18\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_VideoSelector.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
