{"publicApplicationId":"com.vilaltaventures.shapepuzzle","description":"Amelia's Shape Puzzle is a digital version of the traditional geometric shape peg puzzle. The main purpose of the game is to help small children learn the names of the geometric shapes. When the correct shape is matched on the board, the app will say the shape's name, helping children learn the name of the shape. The game can be configured to say the shapes in one of 6 languages: Spanish, English, French, German, Catalan and Italian. You can change the order of the shapes on the board and of the shape pieces. Now every game can be a new game. This game was written for my 2 year old daughter, who helped me with testing.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/vilaltaventures.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.vilaltaventures.com\/forum\/3","custsupportemail":"support@vilaltaventures.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 Vilalta Ventures, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2165404,"installSize":6062080,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-08-13T18:45:48.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.vilaltaventures.shapepuzzle_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.vilaltaventures.shapepuzzle\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_shapepuzzle_2012-15-07_181648.png","thumbnail":"com.vilaltaventures.shapepuzzle\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_shapepuzzle_2012-15-07_181648.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.vilaltaventures.shapepuzzle\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_shapepuzzle_2012-15-07_181659.png","thumbnail":"com.vilaltaventures.shapepuzzle\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_shapepuzzle_2012-15-07_181659.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.vilaltaventures.shapepuzzle\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_shapepuzzle_2012-15-07_181733.png","thumbnail":"com.vilaltaventures.shapepuzzle\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_shapepuzzle_2012-15-07_181733.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.vilaltaventures.shapepuzzle\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_shapepuzzle_2012-15-07_181752.png","thumbnail":"com.vilaltaventures.shapepuzzle\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_shapepuzzle_2012-15-07_181752.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
