{"publicApplicationId":"com.jdisoft.jdisky","description":"JdiSky is the first Astronomy application for WebOS! JdiSky allows you to view the sky as it would appear at any location, at any time or date.\nIt will calculate where all the stars would appear in the sky, where the planets would be, and the location and phase of the moon, and draws it all in an easy to read chart, including constellation lines.\n\nFeatures\n * Calculates an accurate star chart for anywhere in the world.\n * A database of over 3000 stars.\n * Control the number of stars drawn based on magnitude. (Magnitudes greater than 5 not recommended.)\n * NightVision mode for nighttime viewing.\n * Tap an object to learn more about it.\n * Constellations.\n * (Coming soon) Flip the direction of the chart to better suit how you wish to view it.\n * (Coming soon) Deep Space objects.\n * (Coming soon) Rise and Set times for Planets, Sun, and Moon.\n\nChanges:\n1.2.2 - Better bounds to speed things up a bit. Specify the amount of text drawn.\n1.2.1 - Fix a bug where the drawing script could cause a script timeout and the app appear not to launch\n1.2.0 - Added constellations, star filtering, and fixed a GPS bug\n\nNote that, due to device limitations, it is currently impossible to determine where the device is pointed and draw that section of the sky, similar to features in apps on other platforms. Maybe with new hardware....","version":"1.2.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/jdiwnab.no-ip.org","supportURL":"http:\/\/jdiwnab.no-ip.org\/program\/jdisky\/","custsupportemail":"jdiwnab@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 JdiSoft","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":148038,"installSize":1605632,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T08:39:10.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.jdisoft.jdisky_1.2.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"5133\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/Normal.png","thumbnail":"5133\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/Normal.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"5133\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/NightVision.png","thumbnail":"5133\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/NightVision.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"5133\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/Preference_1.png","thumbnail":"5133\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/Preference_1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"5133\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/Preference_2.png","thumbnail":"5133\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/Preference_2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
