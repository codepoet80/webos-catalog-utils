{"publicApplicationId":"com.streetbrew.mobile","description":"What's brewing in your neighborhood? Participate in location-based micro-blogging! Use your phone to create and check-in to virtual walls. Each wall is a pinboard attached to a location, where users can share a variety of information. Streetbrew lets you forward your location-tagged thoughts to Facebook and Twitter so your friends can see where you're hanging out and what you're up to. Browse uploaded photos, rate others' contributions, and join in conversations. Find or post promotions and events near your location. Best of all, make money while you do it. Like the sound of that? It's easy: When a business upgrades a wall on Streetbrew, we reward the referrer and whoever created the wall to begin with.
