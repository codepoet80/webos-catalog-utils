{"publicApplicationId":"com.mycompany.inflation-calculator2","description":"Inflation Calculator HD pretty much does what it says ... IN *HD*! You can look up inflation rates from 1774 to 2011. For example, calculate how much $100 in 1977 is worth in today's dollars or how much a $499 16 GB HP Touchpad would have cost in 1929. Inflation rates are based on data compiled by Robert Sahr of the Oregon State University Political Science Department.","version":"2011.09.01","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/rugopolis.com\/doramjan","supportURL":"http:\/\/rugopolis.com\/doramjan","custsupportemail":"doramjan@hotmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Ryan Durham","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":260004,"installSize":1146880,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-09-07T05:57:44.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mycompany.inflation-calculator2_2011.09.01_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10434\/2011.09.01\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_infcalchd1.png","thumbnail":"10434\/2011.09.01\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_infcalchd1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10434\/2011.09.01\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_infcalchd2.png","thumbnail":"10434\/2011.09.01\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_infcalchd2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"10434\/2011.09.01\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_infcalchd3.png","thumbnail":"10434\/2011.09.01\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_infcalchd3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
