{"publicApplicationId":"in.seeta.touchpad.artis","description":"Atris is a logic game based on the \"falling block\" model of Tetris. The game starts with a grid partially filled with blocks. The player makes a move by removing adjacent blocks of the same color in groups of three or more. When blocks are removed, higher blocks fall to fill their space, and when a column is cleared, the blocks on either side close to fill the gap. The object of the game is to remove all the blocks. Since the patterns of blocks above changes when lower blocks are removed, the player must carefully decide what order in which to remove the blocks so that there are no isolated blocks left at the end of the game. The levels are generated in such a way that there is always a sequence of removals that clears the board.","version":"1.2.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/seeta.in","supportURL":"http:\/\/seeta.in","custsupportemail":"support@seeta.in","custsupportphonenum":"9958054646","copyright":"Copyright 2011 SEETA","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":843866,"installSize":9207808,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T23:07:36.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"in.seeta.touchpad.artis_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9267\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_sc1.jpg","thumbnail":"9267\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_sc1.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"9267\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_Untitled-1.jpg","thumbnail":"9267\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_Untitled-1.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"9267\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_Untitled-2.jpg","thumbnail":"9267\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_Untitled-2.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
