{"publicApplicationId":"com.invasivebamboo.blackbox","description":"Black Box is based on the classic black box puzzle game created by Eric Solomon in the early 1970\u2019s.   In Black Box you have control of a radioactive black box that you are running experiments on. You must find the atoms hidden inside the black box using laser rays. It is simply too dangerous to peer in yourself and in any case it is too small to see the atoms. The locations of the atoms can be deduced by seeing the outcome of the rays.   Black Box is a simply puzzle game you can play while in a meeting (not that we advocate that mind you), waiting in the airport or any other place where you need a mindless distraction. It is simple but at the higher levels the strategy can be deep and take some time.   We hope you enjoy taking a look at this timeless classic from the beginning of gaming on the modern WebOS platform.
