{"publicApplicationId":"dk.denfalskezebra.blockslite","description":"Slide the orange block off the board by sliding the other blocks out of its way. The horizontal blocks only move left and right, while the vertical blocks slide up and down. Solving the puzzles can be very tricky, but don't worry, the first ones are easy and will get you going quickly.  This is the FREE version of Blocks, and only contains the easy difficulty level.  Features: 1 difficulty level, easy (upgrading gives you medium, hard and expert as well). 25 carefully selected and fun puzzles (upgrading gives you 75 more puzzles).  We hope you have fun playing the game. We're keen to hear what you think of it, so don't hesitate to write us with feedback, questions, or bugs (although we hope there aren't any!).
