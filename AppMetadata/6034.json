{"publicApplicationId":"com.rjamdev.onedollar","description":"Just draw... is a new gesture based launcher for webOS. What does it do? Well that's simple! Upon launching the app, you are presented with a drawing area where you draw predefined \"gestures\" with your finger to launch applications and perform other actions on the phone.\n\nSo, another generic launcher you say? Whoop-de-do, and la de freakin' da right? Wrong, that's just where Just draw... gets started. Not only can the gestures be configured to launch apps, but you can also save blocks of text to copy to the clipboard, configure predefined email and text messages to send to your contacts (which can save you lots of time if you send the same message over and over, like letting someone know you are in a meeting at work, or on your way home). There are 16 different gestures included that you can configure to perform these actions, with more actions on the way. Don't like the builtin gestures? Then create your own! Also, the drawing area appears as though you are drawing on your selected background, and when in card view continues to display clear, so you can leave the app open and have easier\/quicker access to launching actions. It's a new, intuitive, & fun way to get things done on your phone!\n\nActions (Currently) Include:\n-Launch Applications (with support for launching multiple applications at once!)\n-Copy Text to Clipboard\n-Send an email\/sms to predefined recipients\n-Call a specified number\n\n***Updates: \n-v3.0.1 Fixes a bug where the clock would continue to run after leaving exhibition mode","version":"3.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/rjamdev.info","supportURL":"http:\/\/support.rjamdev.info","custsupportemail":"nicklas.demayo@rjamdev.info","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 RJAM Development","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":99392,"installSize":3342336,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T20:03:33.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zi6PK90w9oI","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/zi6PK90w9oI\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.49,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.rjamdev.onedollar_3.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"6034\/3.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/transback-max-default_palm_back.png","thumbnail":"6034\/3.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/transback-max-default_palm_back.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"6034\/3.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/transback-min-default_palm_back.png","thumbnail":"6034\/3.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/transback-min-default_palm_back.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"6034\/3.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/onedollar_2010-03-11_201250.png","thumbnail":"6034\/3.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/onedollar_2010-03-11_201250.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"6034\/3.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/onedollar_2010-03-11_201323.png","thumbnail":"6034\/3.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/onedollar_2010-03-11_201323.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"6034\/3.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/onedollar_2010-03-11_201257.png","thumbnail":"6034\/3.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/onedollar_2010-03-11_201257.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
