{"publicApplicationId":"com.supergigamega.weatherdash","description":"Weather Dashboard is a webOS dashboard application that displays the current temperature & conditions as well as the forecast for the next day in a large easy to see format. \n\nWeather Dashboard works like a widget for your webOS device and always runs in the background so you can quickly see the weather. Click on the dashboard to toggle through displays of Current Conditions, Today's Forecast, and Tomorrow's Forecast. Toss away Weather Dashboard and it will come back after it's next update. If your webOS device is setup to enable notifications when the screen is locked, you can see the current weather conditions when your device is on a touchstone charger or by just turning your device on without unlocking the screen. Weather Dashboard will automatically update to your current location if you use the optional GPS tracking setting.  You can also choose to have Weather Dashboard auto rotate through the dashboard view every 3 seconds.  \n\nSee http:\/\/www.supergigamega.com\/weatherdashboard for revision history.","version":"1.3.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.supergigamega.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.supergigamega.com\/weatherdashboard","custsupportemail":"support@supergigamega.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 SuperGigaMega LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":209506,"installSize":8222153,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T03:53:16.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j57_eX6NC38","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/j57_eX6NC38\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.supergigamega.weatherdash_1.3.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"1085\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_weatherdash_1.png","thumbnail":"1085\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_weatherdash_1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"1085\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_weatherdash_2.png","thumbnail":"1085\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_weatherdash_2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"1085\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_weatherdash_3.png","thumbnail":"1085\/1.3.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_weatherdash_3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
