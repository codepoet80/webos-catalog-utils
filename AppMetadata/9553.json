{"publicApplicationId":"com.scrollmotion.agoodfall-9780307378699-rh","description":"In his first book of stories since The Bridegroom, National Book Award-winning author Ha Jin gives us a collection that delves into the experience of Chinese immigrants in America. A lonely composer takes comfort in the antics of his girlfriend's parakeet; young children decide to change their names so they might sound more \"American,\" unaware of how deeply this will hurt their grandparents; a Chinese professor of English attempts to defect with the help of a reluctant former student. All of Ha Jin's characters struggle to remain loyal to their homeland and its traditions while also exploring the freedom that life in a new country offers. Stark, deeply moving, acutely insightful, and often strikingly humorous, A Good Fall reminds us once again of the storytelling prowess of this superb writer. From the Trade Paperback edition.","version":"0.9.903","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"3795210","installSize":"3795210","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"15","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.agoodfall-9780307378699-rh_0.9.903_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9553\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9553\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9553\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9553\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9553\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9553\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
