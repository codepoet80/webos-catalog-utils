{"publicApplicationId":"com.spapp.rpnscientific","description":"v.0.10.21  fixed bug regarding mix-up between portrait and landscape layout (thanks to Ole for reporting bug)\n\nNow optimized for Touchpad as well as phones: \n- Works in fullscreen on Touchpad (seperately optimized for landscape & portrait); \n- App menu is now enabled for app configuration; - User configurable tap feedback (visual, audible and haptic); \n- Retools layout to improve responsiveness; \n- Fixed bug in use of backspace during complex polar number entry; \n- Fixed bug in loose number formatting; \n- Fixed bug in engineering notation\n\nThis calculator is optimized to work seamlessly on the Touchpad, Pixi\/Veer, Pre and Pre3 models.   Includes configurable tap feedback. \n\nScientific, RPN calculator with full and natural complex number computation capabilities.  Modeled after the HP line of calculators, such as the venerable HP-15c.  This is a RPN style calculator; it uses a postfix notation of arithmetic operations, where all the operands (i.e. numbers) are entered into the calculator BEFORE the operator (i.e. +,-,*,\/, etc.) is specified. If this method is unfamiliar to you, please refer to this app's support website for a brief explanation on RPN calculators, as well as links to couple of other RPN tutorials on the internet.  \n\nFeatures of this calculator include a complete suite of function for real and complex numbers: numeric, trigonometric, hyperbolic and statistical functions, work roots of negative numbers, long-click support(alternate functions), floating point error handling, accurate handling of sin(pi), scalable constants, simple statistical computations. Works with on-screen and tactile keyboard.","version":"0.10.21","versionNote":"Now optimized for Touchpad as well as phones:  - Works in fullscreen on Touchpad (optimized for landscape & portrait); - App menu is now enabled for app configuration; - User configurable tap feedback (visual, audible and haptic); - Retools layout to improve responsiveness; - Fixed bug in use of backspace during complex polar number entry; - Fixed bug in loose number formatting; - Fixed bug in engineering notation","homeURL":"http:\/\/spapps.webs.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/spapps.webs.com\/","custsupportemail":"ikmpatel@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 SP Ketan M.
