{"publicApplicationId":"com.developersnice.nicedrudgereader","description":"This is a very fast, no frills, no pics, easy to read and easy to use app that displays the rss feed titles as links from the Drudge Report.  No setup required.   The links open external web pages in the web browser, just like the Drudge Report's web site.  You cannot read the articles from within this app.  Some features are planned for future updates, but for now it is a very fast and simple app.  If you just want a quick listing of the Druge Report links, then this app is for you.  Tested on the Pre and Pixi.  Can you find the Easter egg?  It is not hard to find...\n\nVersion 1.0.2 finally solves the hypersensitivity of the hyperlinks!  I also did some minor tweaks to the font and spacing, to get more info on the screen at a time.  Tested on the Pre running 2.1 and on the Pixi.\n\nDue to user feedback, version 1.0.1 adds a delay to the tap event to stop the app from accidentally opening links while the user is scrolling through the list.  Thanks for the feedback!\n\nTo discuss this app, go to the DevelopersNice developer subform on Precentral.net.","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"Version 1.0.2 finally solves the hypersensitivity of the hyperlinks!
