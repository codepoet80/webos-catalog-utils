These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nHere are three charming fairy tales with happy endings. They feature an enchanted frog; a princess, her brothers, and a dastardly plot against them; and a magical lamp with a Genius inside. (by Laurie Anne Walden)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
