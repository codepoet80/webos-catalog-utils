{"publicApplicationId":"com.andytevansdrewlenhart.joeburps","description":"Available in: English. Mobile apps seem to lacking one thing, no matter what the platform... A burp or belch application! Look no further! Joe Burps is your premier belch application for webOS. Join Joe on his much anticipated sequel to the renowned adventure, Joe Farts(also available in the palm store). Beware, if your afraid of toilet humor, or find South Park offensive, this app may not fit your fancy. But if a good old gross burp makes you smile, this one is for you. Featuring 14 burp sounds and a handy timer to hide your phone and unleash an unexpected burp.  While pressing Joe's burps you will be able to turn on and off the vibrate mode on your phone.  As you press a fart sound, our key character named \"Joe\" does a special pose for you as releases his pent up belches! Joe Burps also provides a quick information page about those pesky belches! Oh and hey, feel free to send us your own burp sounds!  We would be happy to add them! As always if you have any problems, bugs, or feature requests please EMAIL us and let us know, please do not leave a negative comment to share issues or feature requests.
