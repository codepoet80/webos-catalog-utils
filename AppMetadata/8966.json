{"publicApplicationId":"com.thirdwishsoftware.3dcamera","description":"3D Camera enables the camera in your phone to take amazing tridimensional pictures. With on-screen assistance you will be directed to take two pictures of the same scene from two close points of view, and then a 3D picture will be automatically assembled.\n\nThere are a number of 3D picture formats supported, like the common anaglyph formats that can be viewed with colored cardboard glasses. And if you are brave, you can generate 3D pictures that can be viewed without glasses, simply by crossing your eyes!\n\nThe pictures that you take are all generated in full resolution (5MP on the Pre2 and the Veer) and added to a '3D Pictures' album that is compatible with the Photos app. \n\nNote: this app does all the processing on the phone, pictures are not uploaded to a server for processing, and in fact, the app works with no internet connection at all.","version":"1.0.1","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.thirdwishsoftware.com\/3dcamera","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.thirdwishsoftware.com\/3dcamera","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Third Wish Software","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.thirdwishsoftware.com\/3dcamera","locale":null,"appSize":"362040","installSize":"362040","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.thirdwishsoftware.3dcamera_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"com.thirdwishsoftware.3dcamera\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"com.thirdwishsoftware.3dcamera\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.thirdwishsoftware.3dcamera\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"com.thirdwishsoftware.3dcamera\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.thirdwishsoftware.3dcamera\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"com.thirdwishsoftware.3dcamera\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
