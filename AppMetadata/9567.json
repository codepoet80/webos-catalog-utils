For twenty years, Edna escaped the world by devoting herself to the health and welfare of her husband and home, so when she learns he's been having an affair, her sense of betrayal is devastating and literally maddening. And so she sits, silently filling notebooks, trying to find where and how her life went wrong. \"Dancing in the Dark\" is a tightly woven psychological novel, which explores the idea that madness is not necessarily self-destructive, and may lead to a kind of wisdom.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"5318868","installSize":"5318868","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"14.04","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.dancinginthedark-9780307368423-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9567\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9567\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9567\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9567\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9567\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9567\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
