The \"Typing Direction\" option in the main screen allows you to choose how they appear. The leftmost option makes numbers appear from right to left... Tapping 1, 2, 3 will result in 321. The rightmost option makes numbers appear from left to right... Tapping 1, 2, 3 will result in 123.\n\nWhat's new:\n- Added a bit of variety in congrats animations (more to come),\n- Fixed: blank screen appearing on some circumstances,\n- Eliminated swiping animation before displaying congrats\/answer,\n- Support button now links to Ukabu's PreCentral forum.\n\nOpen sourced under the Apache License, version 2.0.
