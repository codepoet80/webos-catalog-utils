{"publicApplicationId":"com.invasivebamboo.sabotage","description":"Sabotage the classic game from the past is now on WebOS. You\u2019re the lone gunman on the front and a constant barrage of helicopters and paratroopers harass you. Try your best to fight off wave after wave of paratroopers as the attacks get more relentless. Shoot them as they jump out to attack you by hitting them directly or taking out their parachutes. If you shoot the parachute they fall and crush all underneath. If they land they become saboteurs waiting for their chance to take out your turret. If four saboteurs land on either side of you they blow up your turret. Occasionally one tries to land right on top of you. Better take him out first because he can take you out immediately.  Sabotage features high-speed arcade game play that starts off easy, but progressively gets more difficult to the point of being overwhelming. You can use the standard tilt or touch screen controls to determine where you\u2019re shooting. Hold down the spacebar for automatic fire but watch your points. Press the space bar for precision shots.  Latency issues that have plagued other games are all but eliminated here.  Invasive Bamboo is committed to updating Sabotage and adding fresh new challenges to this game. Keep your eyes open for updated features as we enhance Sabotage just for you. We listen to your feedback and continue to provide new challenges and features. Palm Pre and Pixi tested.
