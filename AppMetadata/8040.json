These aren\u2019t happy stories, they are about the experience of War. War at different times, and although modern warfare may be more sanitized, the adventure, the horror, the emotions don\u2019t change. James Norman Hall has been there. He \u201cSaw the Elephant\u201d, and his portrayal of his WWI experience is a tribute to those ordinary people who do such extraordinary things.\n\nThose who have served will identify with at least some part if not all of this book, be it the rigors of training, the camaraderie, or possibly those memories that try as you may, you can never make go away. Those who haven\u2019t may gain insight and possibly more respect for those who have.\n\nTommy Atkins is a universal soldier, be he the cook that serves up a hot meal, the sniper that keeps score on the stock of his rifle, or the machine gunner who hates his job. As I narrated this book, I had to stop and compose myself more than once. I could almost feel Hall\u2019s presence, telling Tommy\u2019s story.\n\nMike Vendetti, Narrator\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
