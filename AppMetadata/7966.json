These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\n\u201cIn this book you will not find the stories of all God\u2019s saints. I have gathered a few together, just as one gathers a little posy from a garden full of roses. But the stories I have chosen to tell are those that I hope children will love best to hear.\u201d (excerpt from In God\u2019s Garden by Amy Steedman) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
