He operates with his \u201cseven score\u201d (140 strong) group of fellow outlawed yeomen \u2013 named the Merry Men. He and his band are usually associated with Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire.\n\n    The Victorian era generated its own distinct versions of Robin Hood. The traditional tales were often adapted for children, most notably in Howard Pyle\u2019s Merry Adventures of Robin Hood. These versions firmly stamp Robin as a staunch philanthropist, a man who takes from the rich to give to the poor.
