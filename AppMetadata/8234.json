{"publicApplicationId":"com.joe-hoffman.deckofcards","description":"This simple application is designed to replace the paper AR cards included with your new 3DS system.\n\nNote:  This application is not affiliated with or endorsed by Nintendo.\n\nUpdate 1.0.3 uses slightly different images.  This should greatly improve card recognition.  I was able to get it to recognize with both the Pre brightness at 100% and at 0%.  However, glare can be an issue at times.\n\nUpdate 1.0.2 leaves the backlight on while the app is open.\n\nUpdate 1.0.1 increases performance by drastically decreasing card resolution.","version":"1.0.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.joe-hoffman.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.joe-hoffman.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":399974,"installSize":1310720,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-04-19T06:19:40.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.joe-hoffman.deckofcards_1.0.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"8234\/en\/images\/1\/S\/question.png","screenshot":"8234\/en\/images\/1\/L\/question.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"8234\/en\/images\/2\/S\/mario.png","screenshot":"8234\/en\/images\/2\/L\/mario.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"8234\/en\/images\/3\/S\/link.png","screenshot":"8234\/en\/images\/3\/L\/link.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
