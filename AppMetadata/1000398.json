{"publicApplicationId":"com.hypercanestudios.tortrade","description":"Have you ever wished you could control your SWTOR companions while away from the computer?  Do you long to keep up your crafting skills during your lunch break?  Well now you can, Companion Remote Desktop (CRD) allows you to control your SWTOR Companion characters from the convenience of your mobile phone or tablet.\n\nCRD is designed for low-bandwidth mobile networks so that you can effectively give your companions orders even when you aren't on WiFi.  Although we designed CRD to control companions, it can also be used for other activities in the game such as reverse engineering, inventory management, etc.\n\nIMPORTANT \u2013 This application requires basic computer skills to get up and running. We have assembled tutorial videos and documentation at www.hypercanestudios.com that should make this process quick and painless. This application also requires a free server download as well as a copy of SWTOR to be running on your PC. Know that by downloading this application you will NOT be playing the game in the next 1 or 2 minutes, instead maybe 10 minutes is more realistic. Since this will always be a work in progress we would love to have you contact us with any questions or struggles you may have with our application before posting a bad review on the market.  We are eager to help and are here to make sure you are successful in configuring this product.\n\nTutorial & Documentation:\nhttp:\/\/www.hypercanestudios.com\/p\/crd-manual.html\n\nContact us!\nhttp:\/\/www.hypercanestudios.com\/p\/contact-us.html\n\nLegal:\nThis app is not endorsed by or affiliated with LucasArts, BioWare, or Electronic Arts.
