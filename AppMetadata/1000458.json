A point set is first rolled and then after a series of rolls are done until the dice match the price set. If the user rolls a 7 while setting the point set, the user wins the bet. If during the roll series a 7 is rolled the player losses the bet. To see higher bets tap the 'bet' number, for a max of $500.
