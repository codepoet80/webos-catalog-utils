{"publicApplicationId":"net.webpresso.geotaglogger","description":"Geotagging of pictures just means to store the (more or less exact) position where the picture was taken as metadata into your pictures. While WebOS devices can geotag their pictures automatically, it's not that easy to tag pictures from a photo camera without GPS sensor.\n\nThis is where Geotag Logger can help you: Basically this application just tracks your position (manually or automatically) and allows you to export a GPX file to your USB partition. You can use this file to tag your photos with a third-party desktop application later.\n\nFor detailed instructions pick \"Help \/ About\" in the application menu.\n\nThis application is free and open-source software and licensed under the GPL v3.","version":"0.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/webpresso.net\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/forge.webpresso.net\/projects\/geotag-logger","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"(c) 2011 webpresso.net \/ Raphael Kallensee","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":74350,"installSize":1409024,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-07-14T09:04:32.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":["net.webpresso.geotaglogger.service"],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"net.webpresso.geotaglogger_0.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"9775\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_geotaglogger_0.1_en_01_20110703.png","screenshot":"9775\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_geotaglogger_0.1_en_01_20110703.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"9775\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_geotaglogger_0.1_en_02_20110703.png","screenshot":"9775\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_geotaglogger_0.1_en_02_20110703.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"9775\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_geotaglogger_0.1_en_03_20110703.png","screenshot":"9775\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_geotaglogger_0.1_en_03_20110703.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
