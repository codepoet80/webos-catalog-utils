{"publicApplicationId":"com.pictureplazaeu.memory","description":"With this memory card game you can test and train your short-term memory or just play it for fun! You can even play it with someone else.\n\nYou have to collect sets of two identical images.\nIf all cards are removed the game is over.\n\nNew in this version: You can play memory with someone else. \n\nThere are three levels: Easy, which has a gameboard of 4 x 4, Moderate, with a gameboard of 6 x 6 cards and Heavy with a gameboard of 8 x 8 (8 x 6 pixi) cards.\nEvery time you start a new game you switch between two sets of images which makes it more easy to play games after another. Otherwise your mind will mix-up card positions of the games you played before. \nWhen the game is over, your score will be shown. This is the average number of times you flicked a card.\nWith the button on the right-bottom you can switch between a light - or dark background color.\n","version":"0.0.6","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.pictureplaza.nl","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.pictureplaza.nl","custsupportemail":"support@pictureplaza.nl","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"copyright 2009 B de Keijzer","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":370460,"installSize":4850051,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T03:55:42.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.49,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.pictureplazaeu.memory_0.0.6_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"589\/0.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/L\/memory01.png","thumbnail":"589\/0.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/L\/memory01.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"589\/0.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/L\/memory02.png","thumbnail":"589\/0.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/L\/memory02.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"589\/0.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot3.png","thumbnail":"589\/0.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"589\/0.0.6\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screenshot4.png","thumbnail":"589\/0.0.6\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screenshot4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
