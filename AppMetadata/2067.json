{"publicApplicationId":"com.foxtailsoftware.app.mileagemonitorplus","description":"Curious how good your gas mileage is, and whether you're keeping your vehicle in top condition? Mileage Monitor Plus builds on the mileage tracking features present in the free version of Mileage Monitor, and adds fully custom routine maintenance tracking to the package.  Dust off the owner's manual and tell Mileage Monitor Plus what you need to do to keep your vehicle operating well, and it will let you know when regularly scheduled services are approaching.  You can track service intervals by odometer, date, or both, and set up advance reminders so you know to schedule an appointment before service is already past due.  And once you've set up your maintenance schedule, you're set!  Mileage Monitor Plus knows that once you've done it once, the clock starts ticking again until the next service is due.  Add this to the simple mileage tracking that Mileage Monitor has always provided, and you'll gain even more insight and control over the performance of your vehicle.\nVersion 1.1.2 Update: On screen keypad now includes backspace; minor bugfix.","version":"1.1.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.foxtailsoftware.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.foxtailsoftware.com\/","custsupportemail":"mileagemonitor@foxtailsoftware.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Foxtail Software","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1999832,"installSize":10858123,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T01:21:06.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.foxtailsoftware.app.mileagemonitorplus_1.1.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"2067\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/summaryChartMaint.png","thumbnail":"2067\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/summaryChartMaint.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"2067\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/maintSummary.png","thumbnail":"2067\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/maintSummary.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"2067\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/maintRecord.png","thumbnail":"2067\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/maintRecord.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"2067\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tankDetails.png","thumbnail":"2067\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tankDetails.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"2067\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/maintItem.png","thumbnail":"2067\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/maintItem.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
