Finally a photo editor for your webOS phone!  This \"Plus\" version adds cropping and resizing to our free Photo Effects app. With Photo Effects you will be able to take advantage of several editing features right from your phone. Have you ever taken a picture that you thought would look good in black and white? Or accidentally taken a picture horizontally and wished you would have taken it vertically? You can now rotate, crop and resize your photos without first having to transfer it to your computer. This app will also allow you to convert photos to black and white, sepia, negative colors, and more. After the photo has been saved, you can quickly text or email it to someone right from Photo Effects! Please note that the processing of the images is done via a web service so using WiFi will result in faster processing.","version":"1.0.6","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.rustyapps.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.rustyapps.com\/support\/photoeffectsplus","custsupportemail":"rustyapps@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Rusty Apps","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":450770,"installSize":3659681,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T03:54:38.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZGQcW7onTyA","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/ZGQcW7onTyA\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.rustyapps.photoeffectsplus_1.0.6_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"2977\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screen1.png","thumbnail":"2977\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screen1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"2977\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screen2.png","thumbnail":"2977\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screen2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"2977\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screen3.png","thumbnail":"2977\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screen3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
