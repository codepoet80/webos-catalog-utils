Light-years past a to-do list, Outline Tracker\u2122 helps you organize all of your tasks and associated notes. Organize projects at work, plan a move, a wedding, or a grocery list. \n\n* Organize tasks and sub-tasks as many layers deep as you need.  \n* Outline Tracker\u2019s dynamic to-do list shows only the tasks you can work on here and now.\n* View upcoming tasks in the \u201cBy Due Date\u201d scene.\n* The dynamic waiting list shows tasks that are waiting for action by someone else - tap to contact him\/her \n* Tasks and sub-projects can repeat on an exact schedule (such as the second-last day of every month) or a lax schedule (such as \u201ca week after I last did it\u201d).  \n* Color-coding shows at a glance who\u2019s responsible for a task -- you, your organization, or no one (better get someone on that!)   \n* Items with a due date appear in the webOS Calendar \n* Global search makes it easy to find items\n* Supports David Allen\u2019s Getting Things Done\u00ae (GTD) methodology.\n* Coordinate with others using Basecamp Classic from 37signals.
