{"publicApplicationId":"com.webonastick.flap-clock-3000","description":"There's a free edition of this app now. You can purchase this paid edition if you want to give the price of a good cup of coffee to your humble author. Thanks to all of you who've purchased it so far. :-)\n\nA flip clock you'll have loads of fun with, especially if you're fidgety like me, or just like flip clocks, like me.\n\nDisplays 12- or 24-hour time depending on your Date & Time settings.  At your option, can hide the seconds and the date.  Adapts to your device's screen orientation.  The ticking sound can optionally be disabled; its volume is controlled by the standard system sounds volume in your Sounds & Ringtones settings.\n\nDrag the numbers to change the time, then shake or use the back gesture to reset back to regular time.  This fidgety feature was influenced by FlipTime XL, an app by omletworks available for iOS devices.\n\nBy default, this application keeps the screen on while it is active.\n\nHave fun, and thanks!\n\nv1.2.1: bugfix: normal app launch would stop exhibition mode clock from ever working again\nv1.2.0: Exhibition mode support!\n\n&","version":"1.4.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/webonastick.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/webonastick.com\/flap-clock-3000\/","custsupportemail":"dse@webonastick.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010\u20132011 Darren Embry","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":27322,"installSize":1540096,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T19:45:27.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x-5nZJAuof4","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/x-5nZJAuof4\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":true,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":3,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.webonastick.flap-clock-3000_1.4.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"5432\/1.4.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot1.png","thumbnail":"5432\/1.4.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"5432\/1.4.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.png","thumbnail":"5432\/1.4.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"5432\/1.4.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot3.png","thumbnail":"5432\/1.4.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"5432\/1.4.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screenshot4.png","thumbnail":"5432\/1.4.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screenshot4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
