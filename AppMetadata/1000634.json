{"publicApplicationId":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle","description":"Amelia's Number Puzzle is a digital version of the traditional number peg puzzle. The main purpose of the game is to help small children match numbers with their shapes. When the correct number shape is matched on the board, the app will say the number, helping children learn the name of the number. The game can be configured to say the numbers in one of 6 languages: Spanish, English, French, German, Catalan and Italian. New for this release is the ability to change the order of the numbers on the board and of the number pieces. Now every game can be a new game.\n\nThis game was written for my 2 year old daughter, who helped me with testing.","version":"1.0.7","versionNote":"This version includes 2 different versions of the puzzle and pieces. The original puzzle is included as well as a new \"simple\" theme that looks more like a standard puzzle. Themes can be configured in the preferences screen.","homeURL":"http:\/\/vilaltaventures.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/vilaltaventures.com\/forum\/2","custsupportemail":"support@vilaltaventures.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 Vilalta Ventures, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2219094,"installSize":6160384,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-08-13T18:46:11.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle_1.0.7_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_opening_screen.png","thumbnail":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_opening_screen.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_partial_screen.png","thumbnail":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_partial_screen.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_shuffled_screen.png","thumbnail":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_shuffled_screen.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_preferences_screen.png","thumbnail":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_preferences_screen.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/5\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_preferences_languages.png","thumbnail":"com.vilaltaventures.numberpuzzle\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/5\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_preferences_languages.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
