{"publicApplicationId":"com.weathermapshurricane","description":"The Hurricane Satellite Maps app shows the most current 7 hour NOAA satellite image loops (new image every 30 mins) for all 12 of the Atlantic Hurricane and Tropical Storm areas (Pacific\/West Coast areas to be added soon).  Includes Gulf Coast, Caribbean, entire East Coast, West Atlantic, Tropical Atlantic, etc.  Included are also the 4 'Floater Areas' where NOAA zooms into specific areas of storm and hurricane development.  Each of the 12 areas has 10 different and unique enhanced satellite image loops.  (Visible, Water Vapor, RGB, Aviation, JSL, etc).  \nPlus we have up to 25 different overlays that can be imposed and layered over the satellite loop.  Included are your basic forecasted hurricane path, radar, air temp, wind speed and direction, etc...plus more advanced overlays like hi\/mid\/low level winds, station plots, lifted indeces, etc.\nThese satellite loops and overlays are all Adobe Flash based and run very smoothly and efficiently (let's see the Ipad do that - it can't!).  'Pinch to Zoom' enabled.\nIncluded are Tropical Storm\/Hurricane Graphical Weather Outlooks, Forecasts & Discussions.","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"Minor bug fixes","homeURL":"http:\/\/jancoapps.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/jancoapps.com","custsupportemail":"dave@jancoapps.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 Janco Apps.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":735864,"installSize":1277952,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-09-11T19:38:50.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.weathermapshurricane_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10473\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_weathermapshurricane_2011-08-09_124247.png","thumbnail":"10473\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_weathermapshurricane_2011-08-09_124247.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10473\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_weathermapshurricane_2011-08-09_124040.png","thumbnail":"10473\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_weathermapshurricane_2011-08-09_124040.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"10473\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_weathermapshurricane_2011-08-09_123940.png","thumbnail":"10473\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_weathermapshurricane_2011-08-09_123940.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"10473\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_weathermapshurricane_2011-06-09_091327.png","thumbnail":"10473\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_weathermapshurricane_2011-06-09_091327.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"10473\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_weathermapshurricane_2011-06-09_091221.png","thumbnail":"10473\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_weathermapshurricane_2011-06-09_091221.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
