{"publicApplicationId":"com.p2labs.p2snippets","description":"Trying to highlight more than a few words of text to copy to the clipboard? Frustrated trying to enter complex passwords (numbers, characters and symbols)? If you have messages or canned responses, notes, user names or passwords that you frequently use - store them as a snippet. You'll be able to quickly locate them and with one tap copy the entire snippet to the clipboard, send it to a new email message or to a new SMS\/IM message. Want to have flexibility in your text? Your snippets can include not only text, but dates, times and variables which are expanded on the clipboard. Collapsible categories show you only what you want to see. Now you can have 'current' responses every time you tap on a snippet. Support for categories allows easy organization. Once you try it - you'll never stop using it.","version":"1.0.4","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/P2Labs.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/P2Labs.com","custsupportemail":"support@P2Labs.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2009 P2Labs","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":196254,"installSize":881191,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-04-08T12:40:06.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.p2labs.p2snippets_1.0.4_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"81\/en\/images\/1\/S\/main.png","screenshot":"81\/en\/images\/1\/L\/main.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"81\/en\/images\/2\/S\/snippet.png","screenshot":"81\/en\/images\/2\/L\/snippet.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"81\/en\/images\/3\/S\/targets.png","screenshot":"81\/en\/images\/3\/L\/targets.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"81\/en\/images\/4\/S\/vars.png","screenshot":"81\/en\/images\/4\/L\/vars.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"81\/en\/images\/5\/S\/instructions.png","screenshot":"81\/en\/images\/5\/L\/instructions.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
