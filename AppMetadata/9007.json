{"publicApplicationId":"zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth","description":"This app is an English copy of Ulrich Zwingli's book \"On the Education of the Youth\". It was a book written in the early 1500's to be given as a present to Ulrich Zwingli's friend Gerald Meyer. The introduction of the book mentions that it was presented to Gerald Meyer by Ulrich Zwingli in Zurich on August 1st, 1523.\n\nThis version of the book was translated from a reprint of the 1526 edition of the book. I would believe that it was translated by Alcide Reichenbach, A. M. (Professor of Modern Languages in Ursinus College). The year of the copyright appears to be 1899, and currently there is no copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office.\n\nI am charging $1.00 (USD) for the work of converting this book into a webOS app, and to support further development of this app (including adding more features) and conversion of more books from reformers such as Ulrich Zwingli to webOS.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.gt500.org\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.gt500.org\/forums\/","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 GT500.org","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":94024,"installSize":819200,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T22:02:51.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KHGN3vGnSGM","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/KHGN3vGnSGM\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth_screenshot_001.png","thumbnail":"zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth_screenshot_001.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth_screenshot_002.png","thumbnail":"zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth_screenshot_002.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth_screenshot_003.png","thumbnail":"zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth_screenshot_003.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth_screenshot_004.png","thumbnail":"zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/zwingli.on-the-education-of-the-youth_screenshot_004.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
