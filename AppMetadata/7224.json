{"publicApplicationId":"com.appible.thepickwickpapersaudiotext","description":"This Plus version of The Pickwick Papers includes both audio and text so you can follow along or read without the audio.\n\nIn this app you can download & store chapters for listening without an internet connection, perhaps on your next flight or road trip. These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, better known as The Pickwick Papers, is the first novel by Charles Dickens. Written for publication as a serial, The Pickwick Papers  consists of a sequence of loosely-related adventures. Its main literary value and appeal is formed by its numerous unforgettable heroes. Each personage in The Pickwick Papers (just as in many other Dickens\u2019 novels) is drawn comically, often with exaggerated features of character. \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"302050","installSize":"302050","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.8","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.thepickwickpapersaudiotext_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7224\/images\/1\/L\/thepickwickpapers1.png","screenshot":"7224\/images\/1\/L\/thepickwickpapers1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7224\/images\/2\/L\/thepickwickpapers2.png","screenshot":"7224\/images\/2\/L\/thepickwickpapers2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
