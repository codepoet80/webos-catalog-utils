{"publicApplicationId":"com.nelsun.discogs","description":"Discography for webOS brings Discogs.com (one of the largest user-maintained online databases of records, artists and record labels on the internet) to you an a quick, detailed and easy to use format. With it you can browse and search (Just Type searching is supported!) through the massive catalog, tapping in to all the detailed info available including: catalog numbers, band members, artist aliases, release dates, label information, release notes, images and more. You can also open items in multiple cards to make comparing items a breeze while viewing them in landscape or portrait modes.\n\nIf you have the Amazon MP3 or Spotify app you can call them up to search for whatever artist, release or track you're looking at. This makes discovering old and new music a very easy... and time consuming... affair once you get in to it.\n\nSave items for quick access, share links via email or SMS, save an image to your photos or set it as your wallpaper, search for more info in YouTube, Twitter, MySpace, Last.fm & one user-configurable web site... or even shop for releases in mobile friendly versions of Amazon and eBay. You can even locate record shops near-by when you feel the need to browse.\n\nA few things to note:\n\nDiscogs.com does not make all it's data available outside of the main web site e.g. the market place, updating entries and browsing user collections. When they do we'll look at adding that in. For now we're limited to just browsing and searching the artist, release and record label info. Every item has the ability to open the relevant page on the Discogs.com web site (even on your desktop using the Neato! app) though, so you're never too far away from getting your hands dirty.\n\nWe're always open to suggestions (e.g. common web sites you'd like it to search) and feature requests, so please don't hesitate to send them in.\n\n1.0.2 adds support for Carbon Twitter app.","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.nelsunapps.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.nelsunapps.com\/","custsupportemail":"apps@nelsunapps.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Nelsun Apps","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1158834,"installSize":7503872,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T19:56:43.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XH-RDcz9Cxs","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/XH-RDcz9Cxs\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":true,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":2.49,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.nelsun.discogs_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"6700\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/Search.png","thumbnail":"6700\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/Search.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"6700\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ArtistReleases.png","thumbnail":"6700\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ArtistReleases.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"6700\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ArtistInfo.png","thumbnail":"6700\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ArtistInfo.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"6700\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ArtistArt.png","thumbnail":"6700\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ArtistArt.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"6700\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/Cards.png","thumbnail":"6700\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/Cards.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
