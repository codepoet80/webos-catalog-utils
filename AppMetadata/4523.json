{"publicApplicationId":"com.mrgist.phrasecatcher","description":"Phrase Catcher is a fun and exciting party game! The object of the game is to get your team to guess the word on the screen using clues that you provide. You may also know this game as Catch Phrase from Hasbro (TM). How To Play: Two teams sit in a circle with players alternating around it so everyone is the teammate of every other player. You start the round, and the person holding the Palm tries to get other players on their team to guess the word shown. When their team guesses it, they press 'Next' and pass the Palm to the person next to them. The team not holding the Palm when the buzzer sounds wins the round. Play to any point value.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.mrgist.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/mrgist.com\/contact_us.shtml","custsupportemail":"support@mrgist.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Mr. Gist","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":74192,"installSize":1466820,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T06:14:06.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mrgist.phrasecatcher_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"4523\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/PhraseCatcher-Screen1.png","thumbnail":"4523\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/PhraseCatcher-Screen1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"4523\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/PhraseCatcher-Screen2.png","thumbnail":"4523\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/PhraseCatcher-Screen2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"4523\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/PhraseCatcher-Screen3.png","thumbnail":"4523\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/PhraseCatcher-Screen3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
