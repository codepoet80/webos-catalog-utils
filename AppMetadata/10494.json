{"publicApplicationId":"com.discipleskies.mychristianhoroscope","description":"Just as the stars heralded the birth of our Lord, Jesus Christ, \nthey may predict the events of our own lives. \n\nScholars have long believed that our destinies and the events that shape the courses \nof our lives are intimately tied to the celestial clock, or the \narrangement and movement of the stars through the heavens.\n\nThe sayings and proverbs of our prophets and Lord are linked, like \ntheir own lives,  to the natural tides of the heavens and have \nprophetic meaning to each and every soul on God's earth.\n\nYour birthday is your anchor to the celestial clock and is a link to\nbible passages that foreshadow life events.\n\n\nUsing sophisticated astronomy software,\nthe positions of the stars prior to and including Jesus Christ's formidable years were determined\nwith high precision.  Scriptural clues were then used to establish a time frame for the teachings,\nstatements and prophecies that appear in The Bible.  Using the same software, astral positions for future dates are plotted and are compared to the historical star chart and scriptural text.\nThis information is overlayed on the position of the stars at the time of your birth and produces\nan event projection that is specific for you!","version":"3.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Disciple Skies Software","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2254576,"installSize":5111808,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T04:28:47.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.discipleskies.mychristianhoroscope_3.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10494\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_christian1.png","thumbnail":"10494\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_christian1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"10494\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_christian6.png","thumbnail":"10494\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_christian6.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"10494\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_christian3.png","thumbnail":"10494\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_christian3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"10494\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_christian5.png","thumbnail":"10494\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_christian5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"10494\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_christian4.png","thumbnail":"10494\/3.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/ph_christian4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
