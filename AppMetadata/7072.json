Gogol himself saw it as an \u201cepic poem in prose\u201d, and within the book as a \u201cnovel in verse\u201d. Despite supposedly completing the trilogy\u2019s second part, Gogol destroyed it shortly before his death. Although the novel ends in mid-sentence (like Sterne\u2019s Sentimental Journey), it is usually regarded as complete in the extant form.\n\n    In Russia before the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, landowners were entitled to own serfs to farm their land. Serfs were for most purposes considered the property of the landowner, and could be bought, sold, or mortgaged against, as any other chattel. To count serfs (and people in general), the measure word \u201csoul\u201d was used: e.g., \u201csix souls of serfs\u201d. The plot of the novel relies on \u201cdead souls\u201d (i.e., \u201cdead serfs\u201d) which are still accounted for in property registers. On another level, the title refers to the \u201cdead souls\u201d of Gogol\u2019s characters, all of which visualise different aspects of poshlost (an untranslatable Russian word which is perhaps best rendered as \u201cself-satisfied inferiority\u201d, moral and spiritual, with overtones of middle-class pretentiousness, fake significance, and philistinism).
