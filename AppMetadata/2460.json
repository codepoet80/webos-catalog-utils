Includes a whoopee cushion mode, so you can hide it and release sounds with a timer. Beware, if your afraid of toilet humor, or find South Park, Family Guy, or the Simpsons offensive, this app may not fit your fancy. But if a good old gross fart makes you smile, this one is for you. Featuring 28 fart sounds and a handy timer to hide your phone and unleash an un-expected fart on a person.  While pressing your farts you will be able to turn on and off the vibrate mode. Yes thats right, you can FEEL the fart vibrate you or the unsuspecting prank receiver. As you press a fart sound, our key character named \"Joe\" does a special pose for you as he passes gas!  Joe Farts also provides a quick information page about those pesky farts!  Oh and hey, feel free to send us your own fart sounds!  We would be happy to add them! As always if you have any problems, bugs, or feature requests please EMAIL us and let us know, please do not leave a negative comment to share issues or feature requests.
