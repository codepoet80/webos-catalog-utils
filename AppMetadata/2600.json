{"publicApplicationId":"com.ocd.highoncolor","description":"High On Color is a very addicting game where you guide your player up a never ending series of platforms in an attempt to get the highest possible score you can. You control the player's movements by tilting your phone from side to side. You also have to manage your player's color either by using on screen buttons or with the keyboard. Each platform in the game is colored and you must match the player's color to the color of each of the platforms to land on it, otherwise your player will fall past the platform. If you fall too far the game will be over. As your player gets higher the game increases in difficulty.\n\n\n***New Version 1.1.5***\nMany of you mentioned that it would be nice to play the game with out color. Well, this new version adds an option that allows you to play the game without having to match the players color to the platforms. *Coming soon online high scores.","version":"1.1.5","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.oneinthechamberdevelopment.com\/highoncolor\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.oneinthechamberdevelopment.com\/highoncolor\/","custsupportemail":"highoncolor@oneinthechamberdevelopment.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 One in the Chamber Development","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1329262,"installSize":7348889,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T02:58:00.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.ocd.highoncolor_1.1.5_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"2600\/1.1.5\/en\/images\/1\/L\/highoncolor_2010-10-06_012032.png","thumbnail":"2600\/1.1.5\/en\/images\/1\/L\/highoncolor_2010-10-06_012032.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"2600\/1.1.5\/en\/images\/2\/L\/highoncolor_2010-10-06_012009.png","thumbnail":"2600\/1.1.5\/en\/images\/2\/L\/highoncolor_2010-10-06_012009.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"2600\/1.1.5\/en\/images\/3\/L\/highoncolor_2010-10-06_012050.png","thumbnail":"2600\/1.1.5\/en\/images\/3\/L\/highoncolor_2010-10-06_012050.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"2600\/1.1.5\/en\/images\/4\/L\/highoncolor_2010-10-06_012233.png","thumbnail":"2600\/1.1.5\/en\/images\/4\/L\/highoncolor_2010-10-06_012233.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
