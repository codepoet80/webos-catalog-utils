{"publicApplicationId":"com.appible.talesfromshakespeareaudiotext","description":"This Plus version of Tales from Shakespeare includes both audio and text so you can follow along or read without the audio.\n\nIn this app you can download & store chapters for listening without an internet connection, perhaps on your next flight or road trip. These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nThe following Tales are meant to be submitted to the young reader as an introduction to the study of Shakespeare, for which purpose his words are used whenever it seemed possible to bring them in; and in whatever has been added to give them the regular form of a connected story, diligent care has been taken to select such words as might least interrupt the effect of the beautiful English tongue in which he wrote: therefore, words introduced into our language since his time have been as far as possible avoided. (from the Author\u2019s Preface)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"280738","installSize":"280738","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.8","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.talesfromshakespeareaudiotext_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7106\/images\/1\/L\/talesfromshakespeare1.png","screenshot":"7106\/images\/1\/L\/talesfromshakespeare1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7106\/images\/2\/L\/talesfromshakespeare2.png","screenshot":"7106\/images\/2\/L\/talesfromshakespeare2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
