{"publicApplicationId":"com.appbookshop.epub.thehuntingreferencemanual","description":"Hunting game for food, clothing and shelter is a big part of the story of the human race. It predates the human civilization we know today in many ways. There are many discoveries that are being made that confirm that notion. An Asian fossilized spearhead discovered recently was dated at over 16,000 years old, for example. There is also evidence that we used larger animals for food almost two million years ago. If this interests you and you would like to start hunting, buy this book today and learn everything you need to know about hunting from the history of hunting to what kind of hunting is best for you.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","custsupportemail":"support@appbookshop.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 App Book Shop","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":295450,"installSize":3899392,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T09:09:33.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":3.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.appbookshop.epub.thehuntingreferencemanual_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"5644\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/icon-320x480.png","thumbnail":"5644\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/icon-320x480.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"5644\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/thehuntingreferencemanual_2010-03-10_010347.png","thumbnail":"5644\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/thehuntingreferencemanual_2010-03-10_010347.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"5644\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/thehuntingreferencemanual_2010-03-10_010350.png","thumbnail":"5644\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/thehuntingreferencemanual_2010-03-10_010350.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"5644\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/thehuntingreferencemanual_2010-03-10_010354.png","thumbnail":"5644\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/thehuntingreferencemanual_2010-03-10_010354.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
