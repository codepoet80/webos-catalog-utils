{"publicApplicationId":"com.hattczech.txtgroup","description":"TXT Group is the simplest way to organize your contacts into groups and send messages to all of them at once. The built-in character counter lets you know when you are reaching the 160 character single-message limit. You can easily add or remove attachments, and the preview is larger than the Messaging application. Use the Quick Text feature to quickly send pre-configured messages. Best of all, it's FREE! There are no limitations to the number of groups or users you can add. Donations of $1 or more will remove advertisements (anything additional can be used for multiple devices).","version":"1.0.9","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/hattczech","supportURL":"http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/hattczech\/txtgroup\/support","custsupportemail":"hattczech@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright \u00a9 2010-2011 HattCzech Solutions","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":93728,"installSize":2457600,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-03-16T11:59:06.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.hattczech.txtgroup_1.0.9_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"3015\/en\/images\/1\/S\/txtgroup_en1.png","screenshot":"3015\/en\/images\/1\/L\/txtgroup_en1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"3015\/en\/images\/2\/S\/txtgroup_en2.png","screenshot":"3015\/en\/images\/2\/L\/txtgroup_en2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"3015\/en\/images\/3\/S\/txtgroup_en3.png","screenshot":"3015\/en\/images\/3\/L\/txtgroup_en3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"3015\/en\/images\/4\/S\/txtgroup_en4.png","screenshot":"3015\/en\/images\/4\/L\/txtgroup_en4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
