{"publicApplicationId":"com.glbasic.rpncalc","description":"A Reverse Polish notation calculator for scientists, engineers and geeks.\n\n* Features *\n-quick start up. Really.\n-engineer style exponent display\n-large keys\n-9 memory store banks\n-no stack limit\n\n\nIf you don't know about RPN, read a Wiki article about it (there's a link in the App that leads to the site in your language).\n\nInstead of typing braces, you use a stack and perform operations on the stack items.\n\n(2+3)*5 would be computed:\n2 Enter (push 2 on the stack)\n3 + (add 3 to the bottom stack item)\n5 * (multiply stack bottom by 5)\nThe stack now shows \"25\".\n\nRPN is much faster and easier for large, complex terms. Do yourself a favour for the rest of your life and learn postfix notation. It's easy, really.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.glbasic.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.glbasic.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 Dream Design Entertainment","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.glbasic.com","locale":null,"appSize":"437464","installSize":"437464","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"0.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.glbasic.rpncalc_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7658\/images\/1\/L\/IMG_0019.PNG","screenshot":"7658\/images\/1\/L\/IMG_0019.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7658\/images\/2\/L\/IMG_0020.PNG","screenshot":"7658\/images\/2\/L\/IMG_0020.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7658\/images\/3\/L\/IMG_0021.PNG","screenshot":"7658\/images\/3\/L\/IMG_0021.PNG","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
