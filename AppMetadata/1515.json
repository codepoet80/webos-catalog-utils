{"publicApplicationId":"com.orstudios.spots","description":"*** 1.1.0 includes 2 new easier difficulty levels. Easy and Normal have been added and the original difficulty is now the hard difficulty. *** 1 and 2 player modes *** 2 speeds of animation *** 8 different starting boards *** 3 difficulty levels *** Spots is an addictive board game where the object is to control most of the spots on the board when the game ends. The game ends when all of the spaces on the board are filled, or one player cannot make a move. Each player gets one move per turn to try to capture enemy pieces and moves can happen in one of two ways. 1) You can gain another piece by clicking on one of your pieces and then clicking on an adjacent empty space in any direction. This move will leave the piece you clicked on where it is and create a new one in the empty space where you clicked. 2) You can jump over a space by clicking on one of your pieces and then clicking on an empty space two spaces away from your piece in any direction. This move will move your piece to the new square, but you will not gain an extra piece. After every move, all adjacent enemy pieces will be captured and turned to your colour. Note: The starting board \"Reversi\" does not work well with the easy or normal difficulty modes.","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/orstudios.blogspot.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/orstudios.blogspot.com\/","custsupportemail":"orstudios@gmx.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":57324,"installSize":1776641,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-02-08T20:59:50.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.orstudios.spots_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"1515\/en\/images\/1\/S\/spots_2010-31-01_144607.png","screenshot":"1515\/en\/images\/1\/L\/spots_2010-31-01_144607.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"1515\/en\/images\/2\/S\/spots_2010-04-02_013744.png","screenshot":"1515\/en\/images\/2\/L\/spots_2010-04-02_013744.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"1515\/en\/images\/3\/S\/spots_2010-31-01_144537.png","screenshot":"1515\/en\/images\/3\/L\/spots_2010-31-01_144537.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
