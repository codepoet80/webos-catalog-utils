It recounts the adventures of a young man named d\u2019Artagnan after he leaves home to become a musketeer. D\u2019Artagnan is not one of the musketeers of the title; those are his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis \u2014 inseparable friends who live by the motto, \u201cOne for all, and all for one\u201d.\nThe Three Musketeers was first published in serial form in the magazine Le Si\u00e8cle between March and July 1844. Dumas claimed it was based on manuscripts he had discovered in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale. It was later proven that Dumas had based his work on the book M\u00e9moires de Monsieur D\u2019Artagnan, capitaine lieutenant de la premi\u00e8re compagnie des Mousquetaires du Roi (Memoirs of Mister D\u2019Artagnan, Lieutenant Captain of the first company of the King\u2019s Musketeers) by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (Cologne, 1700).\nDumas\u2019 version of the story covers the adventures of D\u2019Artagnan and his friends from 1625 to 1628, as they are involved in intrigues involving the weak King Louis XIII of France, his powerful and cunning advisor Cardinal Richelieu, the beautiful Queen Anne of Austria, her English lover, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and the Siege of La Rochelle. Adding to the intrigue are the mysterious Milady de Winter, and Richelieu\u2019s right-hand man, the Comte de Rochefort.
