{"publicApplicationId":"com.thomasschoeps.app.pocketfire","description":"Pocket Fire brings the power of fire into your pocket! It simulates a relaxing, visually pleasing fire with amazingly realistic motion. It is ideal to watch if you want to take a mental break and need some distraction. Apart from the normal fire, you can also choose an icy variant and a mysterious hollow fire. To change the type, tap the screen. To create a fireball, move a finger across the screen! With update 1.1, you can also try the new Sun and Bomb modes. With version 1.2, there is a new mode called Pattern. The controls are now adjusted to WebOS - the back gesture can be used to show the menu.","version":"1.2.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Puzzle-Paint\/125772433322","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Puzzle-Paint\/125772433322","custsupportemail":"puzzlepaint@ymail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Thomas Schoeps","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":641420,"installSize":1343488,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-09-29T16:03:00.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.thomasschoeps.app.pocketfire_1.2.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"4281\/en\/images\/1\/S\/screen01_v2.png","screenshot":"4281\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screen01_v2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"4281\/en\/images\/2\/S\/screen02.png","screenshot":"4281\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screen02.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"4281\/en\/images\/3\/S\/screen03.png","screenshot":"4281\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screen03.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
