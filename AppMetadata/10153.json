{"publicApplicationId":"uk.co.elvinibbotson.navigator","description":"Navigator is a fully-featured map viewer and navigation app using Bing road\/street maps and aerial, satellite, oblique (birds-eye) imagery as well as (in Britain) detailed Ordnance Survey mapping. When using GPS navigation the app displays moving maps, coordinates, altitude, speed and trip time\/distance. You can measure distances, search for places by name, mark and return to named places and waypoints, save and export tracks and create and follow routes. The oblique view can be turned N\/E\/S\/W and an optional 'flyover' mode allows navigation by just tilting the phone.","version":"1.0.1","homeURL":"http:\/\/elvinibbotson.co.uk\/equal\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/elvinibbotson.co.uk\/equal\/","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 elvin ibbotson","licenseURL":"http:\/\/elvinibbotson.co.uk\/equal\/","locale":null,"appSize":"94758","installSize":"94758","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"7.5","currency":"USD","filename":"uk.co.elvinibbotson.navigator_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"10153\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_navigator4.png","screenshot":"10153\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_navigator4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"10153\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_navigator3.png","screenshot":"10153\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_navigator3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"10153\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_navigator7.png","screenshot":"10153\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_navigator7.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"10153\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_navigator12.png","screenshot":"10153\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_navigator12.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"10153\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_navigator15.png","screenshot":"10153\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_navigator15.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
