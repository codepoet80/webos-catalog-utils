{"publicApplicationId":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash","description":"Explore tumblr in a new way with Peek-A-Dash. Works for all webOS devices with Enyo. On the TouchPad, Peek-A-Dash is a multitasking friendly popup window. The popup works with any window you have open so you don\u2019t have to stop what you are doing to check on a post! The popup can be accessed at any time from your notifications. Peek-A-Dash\u2019s main function is to view your dashboard posts; though you can also browse any blog you can find a link to in Peek-A-Dash. You can pair the popup with the included Mini Browser that will allow you to browse through posts and view the ones you want, right from the poster\u2019s blog page! You can create categories and sort your favorite blogs between them to view only the posts from the blogs in your category. Peek-A-Dash also allows you to select any blog and explore it, right through the popup window. You can also like and reblog (or queue or save as a draft) posts instantly.\nOn the phone: Peek-A-Dash launches in its own card and acts like a normal app. It will have almost the same experience as the TouchPad, except there is no Mini-Browser.\nSimply swipe left and right to move between posts. Peek-A-Dash supports endless scrolling so you can keep on reading.\nYou can also set it to let you know if there have been any new posts.\nYou must have a tumblr.com account to use this app.","version":"1.0.6","versionNote":"works for phones","homeURL":"http:\/\/chrishptouchpadapps.tumblr.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/chrishptouchpadapps.tumblr.com\/","custsupportemail":"appsbychrisvanhooser@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2012 Chris Van Hooser","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":401986,"installSize":3833856,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-29T18:24:57.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash_1.0.6_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_tp1.png","thumbnail":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_tp1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_tp2.png","thumbnail":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_tp2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_tp3.png","thumbnail":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_tp3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_tp4.png","thumbnail":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_tp4.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/5\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_tp5.png","thumbnail":"com.chrisvanhooser.peekadash\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/5\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_tp5.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
