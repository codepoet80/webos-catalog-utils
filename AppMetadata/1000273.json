{"publicApplicationId":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter","description":"Amtrak Commuter lets you set up any number of point-to-point routes on the Amtrak US\/Canadian system. Easy setup: create a Route picking the Departure State, then Station, and Arrival State and Station. Data is pulled form the Amtrak.com website, and up to 5 trains for each route are presented, along with color coded status. An active network connection is required; timeouts may still occur due to Amtrak.com's website performance.\n\nWorks on any Enyo device including Pixi with updated Bing maps application.\n\nMulti-train routes (transfers) are not supported.","version":"2.1.0","versionNote":"Fixed the Update: Now refreshes properly","homeURL":"http:\/\/translunardesigns.com\/webOS\/amtrak_faq.htm","supportURL":"http:\/\/translunardesigns.com\/webOS\/amtrak_faq.htm","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Trans Lunar Designs, Inc.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":403154,"installSize":1507328,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-08-13T18:45:09.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.49,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter_2.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_I0.png","thumbnail":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_I0.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_I1.png","thumbnail":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_I1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_I2.png","thumbnail":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_I2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_I3.png","thumbnail":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_I3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_I4.png","thumbnail":"com.translunardesigns.amtrakcommuter\/2.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_I4.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
