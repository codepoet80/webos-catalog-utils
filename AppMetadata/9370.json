{"publicApplicationId":"com.jackpot.fallingsandtp","description":"Falling Sand was hand selected by HP \/ Palm as a featured app. The famous Falling Sand \u201cgame\u201d is back!!! The color scheme revamped, the dashboard of elements redone, more functions, more elements, MUCH MORE FUN!!! One of the fastest moving apps and a PDK Hot Apps finalist. There is a HELP shortcut on right side of dashboard, and all items \/ elements on the dashboard when tapped, will display text on the screen describing what they are. All keypad functions and secret elements display text on the screen too! This Touchpad version includes a Keyboard button to open the On-Screen Virtual Keyboard. So, you can either use HELP to launch the help page, or press any keys on the keyboard and if it performs a function, you will see it displayed on the screen. You can literally spend minutes to hours interacting with the falling sand and other elements to create amazing visual effects. If you\u2019re not familiar with the \"game\" you can draw on the screen using your finger, using different elements such as water, ice, oil, fire, and watch them interact. You can draw lines, curves and watch the elements pile up or dissolve them. Use the Torch to Burn Plants. :) Fire to melt through iron or stone. Turn water to steam. Plant a \u201cseed\u201d, water it, watch it grow. Even try tap, hold, then tap with another finger or multi touch spread (like zooming on e-mail and web pages), for psychotic effects. But the most fun is just running the app and experimenting. \u201cCaptivating...\u201d, \u201cVery addicting\u201d, \u201cA beautifully executed port of the classic Falling Sand Game\u201d, \u201cThe most addicting, intriguing, and relaxing app available\u201d, \u201cGreat, fun app that is an awesome time-waster\u2026\u201d, \u201cWtf I have like 30 3d apps and amazingly fun game but I find myself playing this more and more.\u201d, \u201cWHY IS THIS SO ADDICTING!!!!!\u201d, \u201cThere goes my day.
