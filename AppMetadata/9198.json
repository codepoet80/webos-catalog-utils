These factors include the type of activity, duration this activity was performed and weight of the person. The list contains about 300 activities ranging from daily activities to sports and spread over 15 categories for ease of use. Each activity is associated with an MET value (metabolic equivalent) which helps in estimating the amount of calories burned for that activity. Also contains a reset button for clearing the selections.\n\nAll MET values have been taken from the updated Compendium of Physical Activities","version":"0.9.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/ijzapp\/","supportURL":"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/ijzapp\/contact","custsupportemail":"ian.hp.webos@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 IjzApp, Inc.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":38608,"installSize":425984,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-10-10T17:30:32.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dLk_3omrWf0","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/dLk_3omrWf0\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.ianjz.iburnedcals_0.9.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9198\/0.9.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_SS1.jpg","thumbnail":"9198\/0.9.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_SS1.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"9198\/0.9.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_SS2.jpg","thumbnail":"9198\/0.9.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_SS2.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"9198\/0.9.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_SS3.jpg","thumbnail":"9198\/0.9.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_SS3.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
