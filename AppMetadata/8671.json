He examines not only the fossil record but the evidences present in modern living beings that the process of evolution is by no means finished, but ongoing.\n\n    Even at that time, Thomson worried over the future of energy sources. He contemplated the exhaustion of the coal fields and indeed, the eventual exhaustion of all usable energy in the universe, foreshadowing our concept of entropy.\n\n    This book has been consistently among the \u201cTop 100 E-Books\u201d published by Project Gutenberg.\n\n    Summary by Mark F. Smith. \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
