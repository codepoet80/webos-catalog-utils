{"publicApplicationId":"com.tipitap.toodlertappingzoo","description":"Toddler Tapping Zoo: Sights & Sounds\n\nToddler Tapping Zoo will expand the horizons of infants and toddlers through eye-catching images, amusing sounds of animals, and teach them the name of the animals through professionally recorded voiceovers.\n\nToddlers learn to distinguish sounds, associate sounds with images and sharpen their fine motor skills. But most of all, they have a great time.\n\nEnjoy it together while spending quality time or use it in an \"emergency\" to keep kids entertained at a restaurant or check-out line.\n\nOur tapping zoo consists of a carefully selected list of animals. Our application uses the whole screen of the your phone and allows for simple sequential navigation. \n\nToddlers love repetition too. Seeing the same animals over and over helps them learn and allows they to reencounter them often, which for them is hilarious. (We know it can be frustrating as a parent, but they love it).","version":"1.0.6","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.tipitap.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.tipitap.com","custsupportemail":"palmttz@tipitap.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2010 Tipitap, Inc.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":12314866,"installSize":21102592,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T11:33:18.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.tipitap.toodlertappingzoo_1.0.6_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"6409\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/L\/toodlertappingzoo_2010-25-11_162131.png","thumbnail":"6409\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/1\/L\/toodlertappingzoo_2010-25-11_162131.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"6409\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/L\/toodlertappingzoo_2010-25-11_162114.png","thumbnail":"6409\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/2\/L\/toodlertappingzoo_2010-25-11_162114.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"6409\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/L\/toodlertappingzoo_2010-25-11_162104.png","thumbnail":"6409\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/3\/L\/toodlertappingzoo_2010-25-11_162104.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"6409\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/4\/L\/toodlertappingzoo_2010-25-11_162048.png","thumbnail":"6409\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/4\/L\/toodlertappingzoo_2010-25-11_162048.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"6409\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/5\/L\/toodlertappingzoo_2010-25-11_162005.png","thumbnail":"6409\/1.0.6\/en\/images\/5\/L\/toodlertappingzoo_2010-25-11_162005.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
