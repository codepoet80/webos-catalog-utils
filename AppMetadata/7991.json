{"publicApplicationId":"com.appible.thewrongboxaudiotext","description":"This Plus version of The Wrong Box includes both audio and text so you can follow along or read without the audio.\n\nIn this app you can download & store chapters for listening without an internet connection, perhaps on your next flight or road trip. These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nThe Wrong Box is a comedy about the ending of a tontine (a tontine is an arrangement whereby a number of young people subscribe to a fund which is then closed and invested until all but one of the subscribers have died. That last subscriber then receives the whole of the proceeds). The story involves the last two such survivors and their relations, a train crash, missing uncles, surplus dead bodies and innocent bystanders. A farce really. (Summary by AJM)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"278586","installSize":"278586","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.8","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.thewrongboxaudiotext_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7991\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_0.png","screenshot":"7991\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_0.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7991\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_0.png","screenshot":"7991\/icon\/S\/icon1_0_0.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
