{"publicApplicationId":"com.mozzapp.wordfreak","description":"You think you are a master of words? A word freak? Then, this is the game you should be playing. The game will pick a five letter word (with no repeated letters) and you have to guess it. For every guess, the game will show which letters match with the chosen word. If the matching letter is in the same position as the chosen word, it will be marked with red color and otherwise, with yellow. Keep guessing until you find the word. (Yes, it's like the TV gameshow Lingo).  Features: - Beginner and Challenger wordsets each with 500 words to be found. - 20 guesses, 1 minute\/guess, 5 points deducted per guess, 1 hint per game. - Disqualified letters updated as you guess. - Leaderboard to showcase high scorers - Game saved\/resumed if you leave in the middle of a game.","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/mozzapp.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/mozzapp.com\/moZZapp\/Contact_Us.html","custsupportemail":"support@mozzapp.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2009 Mozzapp LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":313966,"installSize":2395714,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-01-06T01:30:10.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mozzapp.wordfreak_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"302\/en\/images\/1\/S\/screenshot.png","screenshot":"302\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"302\/en\/images\/2\/S\/screenshot2.png","screenshot":"302\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
