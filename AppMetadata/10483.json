{"publicApplicationId":"net.jbcg.webpasspro","description":"WebPass Pro is an innovative new type of password manager.  Instead of letting you create your own passwords WebPass Pro creates the password for you and saves it for you.  This stops you from using obvious passwords or writing down passwords so you won't forget them.  Let WebPass Pro do the work, enter in a website address or computer name, select the password type, and hit 'Generate'.  WebPass Pro will give you the same password every time you set the same input.","version":"1.0.003","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.jbcg.net","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.jbcg.net","custsupportemail":"info@jbcg.net","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 JBCG, LLC.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":12793808,"installSize":14319616,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-11-05T06:04:29.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"net.jbcg.webpasspro_1.0.003_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10483\/1.0.003\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_wpp_sc1.png","thumbnail":"10483\/1.0.003\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_wpp_sc1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10483\/1.0.003\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_wpp_sc2.png","thumbnail":"10483\/1.0.003\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_wpp_sc2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"10483\/1.0.003\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_wpp_sc3.png","thumbnail":"10483\/1.0.003\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_wpp_sc3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"10483\/1.0.003\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_wpp_sc4.png","thumbnail":"10483\/1.0.003\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_wpp_sc4.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"10483\/1.0.003\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_wpp_sc5.png","thumbnail":"10483\/1.0.003\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_wpp_sc5.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
