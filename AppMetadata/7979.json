There, by reason of his resemblance to the King of Ruritania he becomes involved in saving the King\u2019s Life and his Throne from the King\u2019s dastardly brother and his allies. Woods, moated castles, pomp, swordplay, gallantry, villainy and a beautiful princess. What story could ask for more? (Summary by Andy Minter)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
