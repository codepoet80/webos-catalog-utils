{"publicApplicationId":"com.gelbintergalactic.lookangles","description":"If you travel in the US and Canada, and you take your satellite dish system with you and must set it up manually every time you stop, this calculator will give you all of the angles required to locate your satellite in the sky. You must know either your GPS location in degrees, the local postal code, or be able to use the GPS system in the phone to determine your location. The elevation above the horizon, azimuth with respect to both true and magnetic north, and the antenna \"skew\" will be displayed. This will work at any location within the North American continent, although magnetic declinations may not be available in the extreme north locations. Many satellites are set up in the catalog besides just the popular DirectV and Dish System satellites.","version":"1.1.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/itfreely.blogspot.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/itfreely.blogspot.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Gelb Intergalactic","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":43550,"installSize":1179648,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-10-27T14:43:50.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.gelbintergalactic.lookangles_1.1.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"5796\/en\/images\/1\/S\/LookAnglesScreen1.jpg","screenshot":"5796\/en\/images\/1\/L\/LookAnglesScreen1.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"5796\/en\/images\/2\/S\/LookAnglesScreen2.jpg","screenshot":"5796\/en\/images\/2\/L\/LookAnglesScreen2.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"5796\/en\/images\/3\/S\/LookAnglesScreen3.jpg","screenshot":"5796\/en\/images\/3\/L\/LookAnglesScreen3.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"5796\/en\/images\/4\/S\/LookAnglesScreen4.jpg","screenshot":"5796\/en\/images\/4\/L\/LookAnglesScreen4.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
