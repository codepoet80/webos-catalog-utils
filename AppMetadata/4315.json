{"publicApplicationId":"com.lieblsoftware.frizzle","description":"*What's new check down the road.* Frizzle - Download what you want where you want. AAAA!!! Stop right there. This is what you CAN'T do: You can't download files from url's which need authentication. You can't download from filehosters (megaupload, rapidshare, youtube, vimeo...), nooo this is also no torrent download app, also this app doesn't enable adobe flash on your device and before some nut asks the emule filesharing protocol is also not supported! Let's continue with the description. Supporting any file and almost any size (limited to the memory of your pre. and to the max. file size of your device (2gb))! Just enter the DIRECT URL or redirect to the file and start downloading. You can also choose where to save the file on your internal storage (default is \/downloads). Open downloaded Files directly with your default Application. Open images through the Image Viewer integreated in Frizzle itself.
