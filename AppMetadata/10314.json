{"publicApplicationId":"com.engineequalscar.enyo.meeting.app","description":"Engine Equals Car is committed to our applications on WebOS. \n\nMeeting notes is the must have for anyone who attends meetings. The application allows you to setup meeting attendees and agenda items. During the meeting just check off the attendees when they arrive and as you move through your agenda keep your notes. Notes can be stored in two ways public and private. The public notes can be combined automatically from all of the agenda items into meeting minutes that can be printer or emailed directly from the application as a PDF. Don't have internet connection at work no problem, all of the data is stored on the device and even pdf generation is done on the tablet, the only time internet is needed is when the email actually goes out.\n\nHow is engine Equals Car going to keep up on this application?\nThis release is a new user interface that is able to be platform independent but still having all of the features. Why you ask, this allow us not to have to choose WebOS or others now. We can continue to develop for our preferred platform but still have the ability to use the code with minor changes on other platforms.\n\nPlease visit our developer forum on precentral.net for update information and to give us suggestions of what you need.","version":"2.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.engineequalscar.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.engineequalscar.com","custsupportemail":"support@engineequalscar.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 Engine Equals Car","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2600732,"installSize":21495808,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T03:55:57.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":4.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.engineequalscar.enyo.meeting.app_2.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10314\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_app_2011-21-09_204219.png","thumbnail":"10314\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_app_2011-21-09_204219.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10314\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_app_2011-21-09_204323.png","thumbnail":"10314\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_app_2011-21-09_204323.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"10314\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_app_2011-21-09_204525.png","thumbnail":"10314\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_app_2011-21-09_204525.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"10314\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_meeting_2011-21-08_125804.png","thumbnail":"10314\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_meeting_2011-21-08_125804.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"10314\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_email_2011-21-08_125813.png","thumbnail":"10314\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_email_2011-21-08_125813.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
