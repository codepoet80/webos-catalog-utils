{"publicApplicationId":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections","description":"With Visual Directions, you can set your route points by either entering an address or by tapping on the map.  \n\nAfter setting your travel points, view your route as either a map overlay or as textual instructions.  You can fine-tune your route by selecting a travel option (Driving, Bicycling or Walking) or by deciding to avoid highways or toll roads.\n\nThe power of the visual method is that it allows you to set your origin, destination & points in between without actually knowing the addresses. \n\nCreate true multi-point continuous routes - view them immediately or use the route manager to store them.   Tap a route in the route manager's database to visualize and get written directions for that route.   It's that easy!","version":"4.1.0","versionNote":"We've heard your suggestions!\n\nYou can now select a travel mode such as driving, bicycling or walking and your can adjust your route to avoid tolls and highways, if you choose.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","custsupportemail":"support@discipleskies.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright Disciple Skies Software 2012","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1503758,"installSize":3473408,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-05T16:59:16.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections_4.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections\/4.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_VisualDirections1.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections\/4.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_VisualDirections1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections\/4.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_VisualDirections2.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections\/4.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_VisualDirections2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections\/4.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_VisualDirections3.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections\/4.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_VisualDirections3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections\/4.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_VisualDirections4.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections\/4.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_VisualDirections4.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections\/4.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_VisualDirections5.png","thumbnail":"com.discipleskies.visualdirections\/4.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_VisualDirections5.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
