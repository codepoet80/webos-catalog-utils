She married mathematician George Boole. She was the author of several works on teaching and teaching mathematics in particular.\nThis short book, Philosophy and Fun of Algebra, is meant to be read by children and introduces algebra and logic. She uses the word \u201calgebra\u201d broadly, defining it as a \u201cmethod of solving problems by honest confession of one\u2019s ignorance\u201d. Using this definition, Boole introduces, in a conversational manner, the concepts of logic and algebra, illustrating these concepts with stories and anecdotes, often from biblical sources. At times, her discussion seems somewhat mystical, speaking of the imagination and angels as messengers which guide one toward the next step in a logical investigation. Boole ends the book with a reminder that algebra\u2019s essential element is \u201cthe habitual registration of the exact limits of one\u2019s knowledge\u201d and a call for the public to keep this principle in mind when encountering any situation.\n(Summary written by Patricia Oakley)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
