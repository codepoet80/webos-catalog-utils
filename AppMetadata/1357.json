{"publicApplicationId":"com.doin.samegame","description":"Same Game is played on a rectangular field initially filled with typically 4 or 5 kinds of blocks placed at random. By selecting one of a group of adjoining blocks of the same color, a player may remove them from the screen by clicking them. Blocks that are no longer supported by removed blocks will fall down, and a column without any blocks will be trimmed away by other columns always sliding to one side. The goal of the game is to remove as many blocks from the playing field as possible.","version":"1.2.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/doiim.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/doiim.com\/","custsupportemail":"contact@doiim.com","custsupportphonenum":"554333715812","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Doiim, Inc.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":346474,"installSize":1998848,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T19:37:42.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.doin.samegame_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"1357\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot.png","thumbnail":"1357\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"1357\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.png","thumbnail":"1357\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"1357\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot3.png","thumbnail":"1357\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
