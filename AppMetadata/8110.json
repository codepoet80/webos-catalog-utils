It deals with the lives of two very different sisters, Constance and Sophia Baines, following their stories from their youth, working in their mother\u2019s draper\u2019s shop, into old age. It is generally regarded as one of Bennett\u2019s finest works. It covers a period of about 70 years from roughly 1840 to 1905, and is set in Burslem and Paris. (Summary by Andy)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
