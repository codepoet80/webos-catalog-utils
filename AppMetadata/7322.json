He soon learns to live the profligate life of a gentleman as he gradually sheds his associations with the gentle souls of his past, Joe (the blacksmith) and Biddy (a level-headed young lady). He throws his money at improving the prospects of his roommate and friend Herbert and his heart at an \u201cice princess\u201d whose heart will never respond. But then an escaped convict from his distant past comes calling, and all Pip\u2019s hopes dissolve. (Summary by Mark F. Smith)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
