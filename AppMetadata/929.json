{"publicApplicationId":"com.ctladvance.frostyslopes","description":"Max the snowman has been dropped on top of the never ending ski slope. His only way down is to ski, but there is one catch, a TON of trees. Weave in and out around trees to see how far you can get on the never ending slope within 30 seconds. The game goes faster and faster every 100 feet, but you can also get an extra boost by holding down the space bar. The game is controlled by using @ and . to move left and right. Pressing Q will pause the game. We have also included a nice sound track which you can activate, just note it may decrease performance.","version":"1.0.1","homeURL":"http:\/\/forums.precentral.net\/ctl-advance\/220500-frosty-slopes-webos.html","supportURL":"http:\/\/forums.precentral.net\/ctl-advance\/220500-frosty-slopes-webos.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2009 CTL Advance CSAT","licenseURL":"http:\/\/forums.precentral.net\/ctl-advance\/220500-frosty-slopes-webos.html","locale":null,"appSize":"2756934","installSize":"2756934","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"0.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.ctladvance.frostyslopes_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"929\/en\/images\/1\/L\/goski_2009-21-12_011139.png","screenshot":"929\/en\/images\/1\/L\/goski_2009-21-12_011139.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"929\/en\/images\/2\/L\/goski_2009-21-12_010956.png","screenshot":"929\/en\/images\/2\/L\/goski_2009-21-12_010956.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
