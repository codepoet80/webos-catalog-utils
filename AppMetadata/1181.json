{"publicApplicationId":"com.mhwsoft.preader","description":"pReader is an eBook Reader for WebOS that is currently supporting plain-text, HTML, PalmDOC, MobiPocket, eReader, ePub and Amazon AZW files. The DRM schemes of MobiPocket and eReader are fully supported, whereas the ePub and Amazon DRM isn't (yet). The files are read directly from the media partition, and no prior conversion is necessary. For example, if you want to read books from the Gutenberg Project, simply open www.gutenberg.org in your device's browser and download the book in a compatible format. As soon as the download is finished, pReader will be able to read the book. Alternatively, you can download them via PC and transfer them to any arbitrary folder on the device's USB disk. Reading in landscape mode is fully supported as is customization of the text-size and appearance. If you leave the application or select a new book, your reading position will be stored and will be returned to if you reopen the file. You can also add custom bookmarks to each eBook.\nPlease do not rate this app with 0 stars if it doesn't finish downloading or fails to install. We have no influence over that. Please contact Palm directly if you have installation problems.","version":"0.8.21","versionNote":"Added Pre3 compatibility.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.precentral.net\/app-gallery\/app-catalog\/preader","supportURL":"http:\/\/forums.precentral.net\/homebrew-apps\/212660-preader-ebook-reader-palm-doc-files.html","custsupportemail":"mschroed@informatik.hu-berlin.de","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009\/2010 MHWSoft","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":356492,"installSize":5570560,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-10-12T21:11:08.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mhwsoft.preader_0.8.21_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"1181\/0.8.21\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_pReader-TP-Main.png","thumbnail":"1181\/0.8.21\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_pReader-TP-Main.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"1181\/0.8.21\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_pReader-TP-Text.png","thumbnail":"1181\/0.8.21\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_pReader-TP-Text.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"1181\/0.8.21\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_pReader-TP-Sawyer.png","thumbnail":"1181\/0.8.21\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_pReader-TP-Sawyer.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"1181\/0.8.21\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_pReader-TP-Meta.png","thumbnail":"1181\/0.8.21\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_pReader-TP-Meta.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"1181\/0.8.21\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_pReader-TP-Props.png","thumbnail":"1181\/0.8.21\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_pReader-TP-Props.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
