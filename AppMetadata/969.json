{"publicApplicationId":"com.shanerooni.cubix","description":"The ultimate 80s puzzle is back!  Using your touchscreen, work your way through solving Cubix!  There are options to make it easy to solve (as few as 1 turn), shake your phone to start a new game, choose from 3 color themes (traditional, light and dark) and more!  When you solve the puzzle, your name, time and number of moves to complete are recorded.  Currently there are two views (to show all 6 sides), and a future update will include a 3D rotating cube for a more realistic look and feel.  A solver is also planned for a future update.  Twist, turn, and enjoy!  ***NOTE: please read the instructions, but in case you don't you can press 'c' to play with a non-timed, clean cube!***","version":"1.0.5","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.shanerooni.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.shanerooni.com","custsupportemail":"admin@shanerooni.com","custsupportphonenum":"484.654.2668","copyright":"Copyright 2009 Shanerooni, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":77246,"installSize":307077,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2009-12-25T11:35:24.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.shanerooni.cubix_1.0.5_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"969\/en\/images\/1\/S\/cubix_2009-20-12_215608.png","screenshot":"969\/en\/images\/1\/L\/cubix_2009-20-12_215608.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"969\/en\/images\/2\/S\/cubix_2009-20-12_215513.png","screenshot":"969\/en\/images\/2\/L\/cubix_2009-20-12_215513.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"969\/en\/images\/3\/S\/cubix_2009-20-12_215713.png","screenshot":"969\/en\/images\/3\/L\/cubix_2009-20-12_215713.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
