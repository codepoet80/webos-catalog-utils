{"publicApplicationId":"com.fridayapps.bubblewrap","description":"How many bubbles can you pop in 45 seconds?   The BubbleWrap app is an addictive, timed BubbleWrap popping game with high scores displayed for the top 5 scores.  Random, surprise \u201cBonus\u201d bubbles are worth 2 points.   You can choose full sheet at a time or random re-inflating BubbleWrap mode.  Preferences also include adding the challenging partial bubbles at the edge of the screen.   App includes popping sound effects with your choice of a phone default sound or custom popping sounds.   The default is a fast, reliable \u201cwhoosh\u201d sound, but not one that everyone considers a good popping sound.  To hear the default sound, be sure to turn off your  hardware mute switch and turn up your system sounds (using the Sounds & Ringtones app).   There are 4 custom sounds to choose from, but these are slow in webos 1.4 and will not work with prior webos versions.  Version 1.2 simplifies sound selection and adds a \"just pop\" un-timed non-game mode.","version":"1.2.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.fridayapps.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.fridayapps.com","custsupportemail":"info@fridayapps.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Trademark 2010 FridayApps.com","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":152846,"installSize":1409024,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T13:08:11.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.fridayapps.bubblewrap_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"1566\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/bwgame.png","thumbnail":"1566\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/bwgame.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"1566\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/bwintro.png","thumbnail":"1566\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/bwintro.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"1566\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/bwscores.png","thumbnail":"1566\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/bwscores.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"1566\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/bwprefs.png","thumbnail":"1566\/1.2.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/bwprefs.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
