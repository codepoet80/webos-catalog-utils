{"publicApplicationId":"com.norragulphalabs.ngconvert","description":"NGConvert is a unit converter for scientists and engineers, but designed for easy use by anyone.  If you travel to the U.S. or Great Britain, you can use it to compare automobile fuel economy, as well as length, time, and mass.  You will also find more technical conversions, such as specific heat, capacitance, diffusivity and viscosity. There are 36 quantities in all, with a total of over 400 possible conversions. The app features an on-screen keypad, with backspace and clear for easy editing.  For converting large numbers, there are keys to enter an exponent and change its sign.  For each quantity, the app remembers your last from-to pair, and the swap button makes for easy back-conversions.  In the Preferences menu, you can change the number of digits in the displayed result, and also change to a comma (vergule) as the decimal separator.  All the conversion factors have been carefully researched, and are the most up to date and accurate available.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"A new look.  Can use a comma as the decimal separator (set in the Preferences menu).  Can now properly enter negative temperatures.","homeURL":"http:\/\/norragulpha.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/norragulpha.com","custsupportemail":"norragulpha@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":70790,"installSize":1081344,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T10:12:36.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.norragulphalabs.ngconvert_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"5037\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/NGC-screenshot1.png","thumbnail":"5037\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/NGC-screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"5037\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/NGC-screenshot2.png","thumbnail":"5037\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/NGC-screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"5037\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/NGC-screenshot3.png","thumbnail":"5037\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/NGC-screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"5037\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/NGC-screenshot4.png","thumbnail":"5037\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/NGC-screenshot4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
