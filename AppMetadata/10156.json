{"publicApplicationId":"com.yirgajeff.webos.bsm","description":"This app lets baseball coaches track hitting and pitching statistics for their teams. Multiple teams can be tracked and for each team an unlimited number of players and an unlimited number of games can be managed. All major hitting and pitching stats are tracked including the calculation of batting averages and earned run averages on a per-player, per-game, and per-season basis. Future versions of this app will include the ability to automatically share stats with the individual players (for viewing on their phones or TouchPads), e-mailing stats to a player's parents, and live in-game stat management with instantaneous updates. I'm very interested in your feedback (including problems and suggestions), so please e-mail bsm_webos@yirgajeff.com and I'll be as responsive as possible.","version":"1.0.7","versionNote":"Hitting Stats are now easier to enter during a game. \n\nVariety of UI layout improvements.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.yirgajeff.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.yirgajeff.com","custsupportemail":"bsm_webos@yirgajeff.com","custsupportphonenum":"9702186075","copyright":"copyright 2011 Yirgajeff","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":119656,"installSize":1671168,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T03:52:17.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.yirgajeff.webos.bsm_1.0.7_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10156\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_bsm_2011-11-09_223109.png","thumbnail":"10156\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_bsm_2011-11-09_223109.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10156\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_bsm_2011-11-09_223135.png","thumbnail":"10156\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_bsm_2011-11-09_223135.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"10156\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_bsm_2011-11-09_223147.png","thumbnail":"10156\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_bsm_2011-11-09_223147.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"10156\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_bsm_2011-16-09_231116.png","thumbnail":"10156\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_bsm_2011-16-09_231116.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"10156\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_bsm_2011-16-09_231105.png","thumbnail":"10156\/1.0.7\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_bsm_2011-16-09_231105.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
