{"publicApplicationId":"com.oceanhousemedia.bookyertletheturtle","description":"Yertle the Turtle, the king of the pond, is unsatisfied with the small stone that serves as his throne. He commands the other turtles to stack themselves beneath him so that he can see further and expand his kingdom. As the stack of turtles get's higher and higher, poor Mack, the turtle at the very bottom of the pile, is in great pain. Finally fed up with Yertle's abuse, the plain little turtle named Mack does something to upset the balance of power and free all the turtles.\n\n\u2605 Please note that HP is resolving an error with the license check process to allow this app to run while you are offline.
