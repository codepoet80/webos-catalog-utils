{"publicApplicationId":"com.bscsoftware.energyviewerdemo","description":"This is a Demo for the Energy Viewer. The Energy Viewer application displays usage information from TED\u00ae 5000 devices. The Energy Viewer\u2019s Today dashboard display provides current and recorded power, cost, and voltage information from the TED\u00ae (The Energy Detective) device. It also provides information for the current month and detailed screens for Cost, Voltage, and Power. The Energy Viewer supports multi-MTU systems.\n\nThe only limitations for the Demo version are that it will only allow you to save the refresh rate and the default MTU values in the preference view.\n\nThe Energy Viewer application requires your TED\u00ae 5000 devices to be connected to the internet to be able to view your information away from your home, or to a WiFi enabled home network to view in your home on a WiFi enabled Webos device.\n\nNote: You must already have a TED\u00ae 5000 device installed and set up in your house or business to be able to use this application to see your specific energy readings.","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"Updated to include Login functionality and added power factor and CO2 readout to Today view.","homeURL":"http:\/\/energyviewer.webs.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/energyviewer.webs.com\/","custsupportemail":"gray.bscsoftware@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 BSCSoftware \/ BSC Enterprise, Inc.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":18376,"installSize":1048576,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-04-06T01:11:34.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.bscsoftware.energyviewerdemo_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"8168\/en\/images\/1\/S\/Today_V1_1.JPG","screenshot":"8168\/en\/images\/1\/L\/Today_V1_1.JPG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"8168\/en\/images\/2\/S\/main_menu_view.JPG","screenshot":"8168\/en\/images\/2\/L\/main_menu_view.JPG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"8168\/en\/images\/3\/S\/Cost_Detail_view.JPG","screenshot":"8168\/en\/images\/3\/L\/Cost_Detail_view.JPG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"8168\/en\/images\/4\/S\/Power_Detail_V1_1.JPG","screenshot":"8168\/en\/images\/4\/L\/Power_Detail_V1_1.JPG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"8168\/en\/images\/5\/S\/AppIconView.JPG","screenshot":"8168\/en\/images\/5\/L\/AppIconView.JPG","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
