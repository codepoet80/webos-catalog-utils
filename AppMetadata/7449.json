{"publicApplicationId":"com.l337tech.tap-to-the-beat","description":"Tap To The Beat! is a dead simple app.  Simply tap in the \"tap area\" to a heartbeat, or music, or choreography and the app will display the bpm (beats per minute).  You can then save and name the save so you view previous bpm calculations.  The app also saves the min and max beats during the session.  There is also an option to change the number of samples taken before the bpm is calculated.  This typically helps with proper bpm calculation since human taps are usually different no matter how hard we try to tap the the beat.  \n\nSee this apps webpage for details:\nhttp:\/\/www.l337tech.com\/apps\/tap-to-the-beat\/\n\nCasey Broome\nL337Tech.com","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.l337tech.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.l337tech.com\/apps\/tap-to-the-beat\/","custsupportemail":"comments@l337tech.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":228192,"installSize":1409024,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-01-25T03:25:04.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.l337tech.tap-to-the-beat_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"7449\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tap-to-the-beat_2011-24-01_082346.png","screenshot":"7449\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tap-to-the-beat_2011-24-01_082346.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"7449\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tap-to-the-beat_2011-24-01_082510.png","screenshot":"7449\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tap-to-the-beat_2011-24-01_082510.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"7449\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tap-to-the-beat_2011-24-01_082531.png","screenshot":"7449\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tap-to-the-beat_2011-24-01_082531.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
