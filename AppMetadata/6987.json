{"publicApplicationId":"com.nelsun.googly","description":"Goo.gly is a web address or URL shortener using Google's goo.gl service to take an address of any length and make it small for sending via Twitter, SMS or other means where characters are limited. Once logged in to Google it can even keep track of your links and show you how many times they've been clicked, where they were clicked, which browser and on which operating system was used at the time.\n\nSimply enter the address you want to shorten and very quickly (goo.gl is lightening fast!) get a shortened address which you can very easily then copy to the clipboard, tweet it (15 Twitter apps supported), send it by email, SMS & Neato!, post it to Facebook, get a QR Code or add it to Relego or Spare Time to read later.\n\nIt also comes with user configurable gestures: forward swipe, top down drag, 2 finger drag and shake.\n\nWe're always looking to expand the app with more features, so please send in any requests you have.\n\nVersion 1.2.3 adds support for Quick Post and Spaz Special Edition apps.\nVersion 1.2.2 adds support for Carbon Twitter app.\nVersion 1.2.1 fixes a couple of bugs and adds user configurable gestures.\nVersion 1.2 adds cross app launching (other apps can now shorten URLs using Goo.gly) and some usability improvements.\nVersion 1.1 adds history list, click tracking reports and usability improvements - see the What's New scene for the full list.","version":"1.2.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.nelsunapps.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.nelsunapps.com","custsupportemail":"apps@nelsunapps.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Nelsun Apps","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":312984,"installSize":4456448,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-05-16T17:12:49.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.nelsun.googly_1.2.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"6987\/en\/images\/1\/S\/Googly.png","screenshot":"6987\/en\/images\/1\/L\/Googly.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"6987\/en\/images\/2\/S\/Googly-History.png","screenshot":"6987\/en\/images\/2\/L\/Googly-History.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"6987\/en\/images\/3\/S\/Googly-Tracking-Report.png","screenshot":"6987\/en\/images\/3\/L\/Googly-Tracking-Report.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"6987\/en\/images\/4\/S\/Googly-Preferences.png","screenshot":"6987\/en\/images\/4\/L\/Googly-Preferences.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"6987\/en\/images\/5\/S\/Googly-Preferences-Twitter-Apps.png","screenshot":"6987\/en\/images\/5\/L\/Googly-Preferences-Twitter-Apps.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
