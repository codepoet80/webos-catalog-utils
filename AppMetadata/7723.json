{"publicApplicationId":"org.voltar.jlt","description":"The JLT is a really generic location posting mechanism that can be tuned while the app is running.  This app is a single card that controls all the aspects (URL, rate, and buffer size) of posting location data to a website.\n\nServers can send a current position view URL to the client.  The client can then send the view URL to others via IM or Email.  There are also meta data features for POI (points of interest) and trip tagging.\n\nThis app is intended to be the client companion to your own website.  However, the author also realized that most people won't spend to the time to create their own collection endpoint and therefore constructed http:\/\/db.JGPS.me\/ \u2014 set up as default in the app.\n\nIf you are interested in creating your own collector, you will find several example website applications on Github. Contributions welcome.  The entire source of this app can also be found there.\n\nThis app is intended to be fairly nerdy.  If you're looking for polish and simplicity, maybe move on.  If you like the idea of tuning data collection, maybe try this one.\n\nOh, one last thing; this is the tip jar edition.  You can also install this for free via precentral.net.","version":"0.95.4","versionNote":"","homeURL":"https:\/\/voltar.org\/","supportURL":"https:\/\/voltar.org\/","custsupportemail":"jlt-support@voltar.org","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Paul Miller","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":68764,"installSize":1736704,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T21:35:08.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8kllIuu-iuo","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/8kllIuu-iuo\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"org.voltar.jlt_0.95.4_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"7723\/0.95.4\/en\/images\/1\/L\/jlt-screener.png","thumbnail":"7723\/0.95.4\/en\/images\/1\/L\/jlt-screener.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"7723\/0.95.4\/en\/images\/2\/L\/browser_2011-03-03_120604.png","thumbnail":"7723\/0.95.4\/en\/images\/2\/L\/browser_2011-03-03_120604.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"7723\/0.95.4\/en\/images\/3\/L\/email_2011-03-03_133009.png","thumbnail":"7723\/0.95.4\/en\/images\/3\/L\/email_2011-03-03_133009.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"7723\/0.95.4\/en\/images\/4\/L\/browser_2011-03-03_120436.png","thumbnail":"7723\/0.95.4\/en\/images\/4\/L\/browser_2011-03-03_120436.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
