{"publicApplicationId":"com.mycompany.inflation-calculator","description":"Inflation Calculator pretty much does what it says.  You can look up inflation rates from 1774 to 2011.  For example, calculate how much $100 in 1977 is worth in today's dollars or how much a $149 32 GB HP Touchpad would have cost in 1929.  Inflation rates are based on data compiled by Robert Sahr of the Oregon State University Political Science Department.","version":"0.2011.07","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/rugopolis.com\/doramjan","supportURL":"http:\/\/rugopolis.com\/doramjan","custsupportemail":"doramjan@hotmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Ryan Durham","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":87008,"installSize":950272,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-09-29T07:21:41.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mycompany.inflation-calculator_0.2011.07_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"6528\/0.2011.07\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_inflationscreenshot1.JPG","thumbnail":"6528\/0.2011.07\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_inflationscreenshot1.JPG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"6528\/0.2011.07\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_inflationscreenshot2.JPG","thumbnail":"6528\/0.2011.07\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_inflationscreenshot2.JPG","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"6528\/0.2011.07\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_inflationscreenshot3.JPG","thumbnail":"6528\/0.2011.07\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_inflationscreenshot3.JPG","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
