Parts of the story may have been derived from the capture and death of Jane McCrea in July 1777 near Fort Edward, New York, by members of an Algonquian tribe.\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
