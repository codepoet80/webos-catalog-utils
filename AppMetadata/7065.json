When it was published, the Spectator described it as a \u201cpoisonous book \u2026 capable of poisoning the minds of those who read it.\u201d Although it is unlikely to offend modern listeners in this way, this novel addresses many feminist issues that are still relevant today. (Summary by Joy Chan)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
