{"publicApplicationId":"com.appbookshop.copingwithadhd","description":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a hard disorder to pin point. The symptoms are hard to read as they are similar to that of a bored child who simply wants something to do. Unlike the bored child however, the ADHD doesn't go away once the child is occupied. ADHD diminishes the persons ability in all facets of school and work life and makes it near impossible for the sufferer to reach their potential. This can cause frustration and depression as the person continues to lose focus and is constantly reprimanded for their inappropriate actions. Dealing with this disorder is not easy. Concentration and the ability to focus cannot always be fixed with prescription drugs. If you want to learn more about ADHD and what you can do to help, you need to download the Coping With ADHD ebook today! \n","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","custsupportemail":"support@appbookshop.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright AppBookShop 2010","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":285372,"installSize":5042873,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T03:05:13.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":3.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.appbookshop.copingwithadhd_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"3499\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/copingwithadhd_2010-12-06_144817.png","thumbnail":"3499\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/copingwithadhd_2010-12-06_144817.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"3499\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/copingwithadhd_2010-12-06_144827.png","thumbnail":"3499\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/copingwithadhd_2010-12-06_144827.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"3499\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/copingwithadhd_2010-12-06_144834.png","thumbnail":"3499\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/copingwithadhd_2010-12-06_144834.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
