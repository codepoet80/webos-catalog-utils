{"publicApplicationId":"com.jakyl.frootrees","description":"Highly addictive, this is the full version of the well received iPhone froot-picking game.\n\nGrow and harvest Froot from your own personal Frootree. Pluck feisty Plum, confused Pear, cool Orange and anxious Apple from their branches as they yawn and giggle their way to life and collect them in your Frootbaskets.\n\nFrootrees is great for beginners, but to reap the ultimate harvesting rewards, risks must be taken and Froot-picking skills matured. To score points players must pluck Froot before they wither and fall to the ground. Picking Froot at their ripest means maximum points will be achieved. A number of well-timed plucks in a row will lead to multipliers, and fighting gravity will give extra bonus points too.\n\nThe cute Froots will keep you entertained as they blossom, and they will continue to grow so you can continue to harvest. Challenge friends and family in this classic arcade-style Froot-picking extravaganza.\n\nv.1.1.1 adds a dead froot countdown in the bottom right corner. Tapping the dead froot countdown will end your game immediately. \n\n[If you have issues with the app running, please try restarting your phone or drop us an email]","version":"1.1.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.tinmangames.com.au\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.tinmangames.com.au\/","custsupportemail":"info@tinmangames.com.au","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright Tin Man Games 2009-2010","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2272964,"installSize":5505024,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-10-14T09:35:58.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ibj1SlPCh5U","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/ibj1SlPCh5U\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.jakyl.frootrees_1.1.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"4752\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/Screenshot1.jpg","thumbnail":"4752\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/Screenshot1.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"4752\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/Screenshot2.jpg","thumbnail":"4752\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/Screenshot2.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"4752\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/Screenshot3.jpg","thumbnail":"4752\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/Screenshot3.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"4752\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/Screenshot4.jpg","thumbnail":"4752\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/Screenshot4.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
