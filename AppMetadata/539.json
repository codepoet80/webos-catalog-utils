{"publicApplicationId":"com.xivix.quran","description":"Read the Holy Quran on your Webos device.  This app includes the Arabic Text, English Translation, English Transliteration, and recitations of the Quran.  You can easily bring up any Sura and read through it while listening to the recitation play in the background.  This app requires you to copy some data to the Media Partition of your phone after installation. The MP3s for the recitation are too big to be installed with the app.  -=Update=- The Arabic Text is now included in the app instead of being part of the separate download.  The MP3s must still be downloaded separately.","version":"1.0.7","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.xivix.net","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.xivix.net","custsupportemail":"support@xivix.net","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"copyright 2009 Xivix Software Solutions","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":20842550,"installSize":14823600,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-07-13T19:19:40.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.xivix.quran_1.0.7_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"539\/en\/images\/1\/S\/quran_1.jpg","screenshot":"539\/en\/images\/1\/L\/quran_1.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"539\/en\/images\/2\/S\/quran_3.jpg","screenshot":"539\/en\/images\/2\/L\/quran_3.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"539\/en\/images\/3\/S\/quran_5.jpg","screenshot":"539\/en\/images\/3\/L\/quran_5.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"539\/en\/images\/4\/S\/quran_6.jpg","screenshot":"539\/en\/images\/4\/L\/quran_6.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
