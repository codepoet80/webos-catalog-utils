{"publicApplicationId":"com.graucoastal.contractiontime","description":"This app is for expectant mothers and everyone who helps expectant mothers time their labor contractions.  Of course you can use a watch and paper, but this app makes it a breeze to keep track.  When a pain first starts, simply tap on the top of the screen, a spinner appears to indicate the contraction is in progress, when the pain eases off, tap the top of the screen again and the duration is displayed.  When the next contraction starts, simply touch the top of the screen again, the time between contractions will display and the process repeats.  Forgot to record to a contraction?  No problem press the \u201cminus\u201d button and you can delete incomplete\/incorrect records.  While we can't take away labor pains, this app makes it painless to keep track of the duration and interval of contractions for every pregnant mother.
