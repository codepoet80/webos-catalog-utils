{"publicApplicationId":"com.kokomolabs.app.signwave","description":"When just a wave won't suffice, you need SignWave!\nSignWave is a trippy banner-like program that utilizes persistence of vision to make short messages appear to float in mid-air as you wave your phone from side to side.\nYou can enter short messages, pick from a set of icons, specify the text color, and even save your Favorites.\nThe effect works best in a dimly lit room, like a bar or theater.\nThis update features the addition of icons in the message editor, quicker rendering, and changes to the wave adaptation algorithm for improved ease-of-use and *slightly* improved readability.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/signwave.kokomolabs.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/signwave.kokomolabs.com","custsupportemail":"signwave@kokomolabs.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Kokomo Labs","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":20172,"installSize":2363246,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T04:07:49.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TMh11wsVNBw","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/TMh11wsVNBw\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.kokomolabs.app.signwave_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"3931\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot_1.png","thumbnail":"3931\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot_1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"3931\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot_2.png","thumbnail":"3931\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot_2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"3931\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot_3.png","thumbnail":"3931\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot_3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"3931\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screenshot_4.png","thumbnail":"3931\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screenshot_4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
