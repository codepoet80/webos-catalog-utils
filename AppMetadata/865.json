{"publicApplicationId":"com.xybyresoft.trimatch","description":"Tri-Match is a matching game, similar to Bejeweled. You must match three or more objects by swapping any two adjacent objects. Match more than three objects to receive bonuses! \n\nTri-Match has many special features: \n\n1. [updated] Although the objects may seem small and hard to select, the object's touchable area is actually four times larger! This means that you don't have to be precise with your moves. Just touch the object you want to move and slide your finger in the direction of the object you want to swap with. Don't worry if you missed the object by a little bit. Tri-match is smart enough to deduce your intended move!  If it chose the wrong move, you can undo the move (Pixi users: press 'U' to activate).  The undo feature is disabled for five moves once you use it (to prevent abuse).\n\n2. Smooth animation and special effects. \n\n3. Automatically resume play if you need to close the app. \n\n4. Tri-Match automatically gives you a hint if you can't find a move. 5. Create special explosive objects by matching 4 or more objects. When your game ends, there is a chance that these will explode to save you! \n\n6. Instant Replay! Did you just get an awesome combo? Did the action go by too fast to follow? Watch it again in slow motion! Pixi users can press 'R' on the keyboard to invoke this feature. \n\n7. Get a speed bonus for making moves quickly! The bonus dwindles away if you take too long to move. You can also queue up moves while your current move is in motion. \n\n8. Three game modes: Free Play, which lets you enjoy the game at your own pace, or Timed (3-minute) and Blitz (1-minute) modes. \n\n9. High scores are tracked, locally and globally.  Show the world how good you are!  If someone else plays the game, they can change the player name so that their score is credited properly.\n\n10. The game automatically pauses when the app is minimized. \n\n* v1.2.1 added particle effects for explosions\n* v1.2.2 fixes compatibility issues with WebOS 1.4, Undo feature added","version":"1.2.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/xybyresoft.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/xybyresoft.com","custsupportemail":"support@xybyresoft.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Xybyresoft","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":292760,"installSize":2335314,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T00:15:10.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VqO6DrPa6Kg","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/VqO6DrPa6Kg\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.xybyresoft.trimatch_1.2.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"865\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tm_cap1.jpg","thumbnail":"865\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tm_cap1.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"865\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tm_cap2.jpg","thumbnail":"865\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tm_cap2.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"865\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tm_cap3.jpg","thumbnail":"865\/1.2.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tm_cap3.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
