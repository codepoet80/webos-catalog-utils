{"publicApplicationId":"com.appbookshop.epub.learnallaboutpodcasting","description":"Podcast downloads are a wonderful new online way to share files. A podcast is a way to send files from a distributor's online site directly to the subscribers computer, where they can view them whenever they wish. A podcast works by having a small file called an RSS file placed somewhere on the podcaster's web page. This RSS file is updated regularly, usually automatically with text and links to new media files available for downloading. The RSS file is then accessed by the podcast client of the subscriber's computer. A podcast client is a small program that goes online to look for the RSS files that the feed subscribers wish to view. There are many podcast clients available for every conceivable need, and most are free to download and use.
