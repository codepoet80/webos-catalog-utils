{"publicApplicationId":"com.wog.clicktrainer","description":"A Clicker & a Dog Whistle, plus some fun added in!\n\nWe recorded our clicker sounds in a sound studio from real dog clickers - no manufactured sounds.\n\nChoose the whistle sound, then the clicker sound and press the button - it's that simple. Your choices will be saved too.\n\nAfter working with a local veterinary company, we developed this app to help you train your dog to your vocal and hand commands. When you press the paw button, the clicker sound will play, followed by the dog whistle sound you have chosen. When your pet looks at where the sound is coming from, you should clearly state your vocal command as well as use your hand signal. Be sure to use treats and positive reinforcement throughout training and, before long, your pet will be responding to your commands.\n\nWe also added in some fun sounds that made our pets ears perk up, like dogs barking, birds chirping, cats meowing, and more!","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/3cgdeveloping.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/webosgroup.com","custsupportemail":"support@webosgroup.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 WebOS Group","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1237824,"installSize":2719744,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T18:38:24.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.wog.clicktrainer_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"2":{"screenshot":"8199\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_clicktrainer.png","thumbnail":"8199\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_clicktrainer.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"8199\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_clicktrainer.png","thumbnail":"8199\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_clicktrainer.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
