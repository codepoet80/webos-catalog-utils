We're not about the most expensive shops, bars, restaurants and hotels - we're about the best. All our guides are compiled by writers who have lived in each city, with content that is packed with insider knowledge and a voice that is irreverent, inspired, and, above all, intelligent. All Hg2 travel content is stored on your TouchPad - only using data connections for features such as maps, check-in and sound track to the city to minimise data roaming costs.
