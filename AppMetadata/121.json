{"publicApplicationId":"com.engineequalscar.games.mines","description":"The original Mine Sweeper Style game for WebOs.\n********************************\nUpdated in version 2.0.0: \\n\nAdded a easy way to switch between tap functions (space button toggles, volume up flags as a mine, volume down reveals the square).\n********************************\n\nMine searcher is our take on this classic game. The object of the game is to select tiles to clear the field and to avoid mines. As the tiles are selected the number of mines that are adjacent to that tile is revealed to help the player determine the mines' locations. The game allows you to change board size and the number of mines in the field for varying difficulty and endless fun. Records are kept so you can keep track of your best times. &","version":"2.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.engineequalscar.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.engineequalscar.com","custsupportemail":"tonyparisi@engineequalscar.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright Engine Equals Car","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":408324,"installSize":4524506,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-05-31T23:44:37.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.engineequalscar.games.mines_2.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"121\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/mines_2009-08-09_061656.jpg","thumbnail":"121\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/mines_2009-08-09_061656.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"121\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/mines_2009-20-08_071859_256A3E.jpg","thumbnail":"121\/2.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/mines_2009-20-08_071859_256A3E.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
