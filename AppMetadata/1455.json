{"publicApplicationId":"com.baonproductions.navydefense","description":"MOVE YOUR GUN'S CROSSHAIR AND SHOOT DOWN THE INCOMING AIRCRAFTS THAT ARE BOMBING AWAY AT YOUR SHIP! Extremely challenging and fast-paced game as you use the on-screen thumb-pad to control your crosshair to fire at the enemy! The game has 15 LEVELS of play with 5 UNIQUE BACKDROPS around the world; you will recognize these trademark landscapes. Switch between your fast shooting MACHINE GUN or your more deadly, but slower CANNON to ward off 5 DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENEMY AIRCRAFTS and 3 BOSSES. Lots of attention was paid to details, whether its bits and pieces of aircraft debris falling about, enemy aircrafts shaking and smoking when badly damaged, or water splashes when the bomb barely misses your ship! Make sure you wipe out all the enemy before your ship's life indicator drops down to 0. Be quick and resolute, but make sure you don't hit your friendly or will pay the price. Please take a look at our website for other games such as Puzzle Fun, Slalom Skiing, Whack-A-Molly, Shooter, and Chronic Attack.","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.baonproductions.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.baonproductions.com","custsupportemail":"info@baonproductions.com","custsupportphonenum":"703.867.8912","copyright":"copyright 2010 Baon Productions","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":4002594,"installSize":12869200,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T02:00:23.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.baonproductions.navydefense_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"1455\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/nvss1.png","thumbnail":"1455\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/nvss1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"1455\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ss2.png","thumbnail":"1455\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ss2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"1455\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ss1.png","thumbnail":"1455\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ss1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
