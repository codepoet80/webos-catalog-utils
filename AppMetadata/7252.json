However, tucked in among the rocks and hills lies an unfamiliar outpost which he\u2019s been told is called Fort o\u2019 God whose inhabitants and history are shrouded in mystery. It is Jeanne D\u2019Arcambal and her protector Pierre who have told him of this place, but there is so much which they haven\u2019t told him, including who they really are, where they come from, and their clouded past.
