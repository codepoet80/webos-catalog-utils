{"publicApplicationId":"net.abern.exoplanets","description":"ExoPlanets is an addictive speed game that takes no-time to learn and enjoy playing.  Align 3 to 5 planets to form a \"Syzygy\" along the middle \"inter-orbit plane\".  Earn as much points as you can as you go through stages with progressive speed and exoplanet variety.  Blackholes arrive seldomly at later stages so align 5 when you can  to help you clear out the board, at least for the moment.  But while you don't need them, keep them away from the \"inter-orbit plane\" because they prevent exoplanet annihilation. 1.1.21 UPDATE: Optimized code to reduce lagging. Added monochrome planets option provided for either an extra challenge or for color-blind accessibility.","version":"1.1.21","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/developer.abern.net","supportURL":"http:\/\/developer.abern.net","custsupportemail":"arnold@abern.net","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Arnold Bernabe","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":3095360,"installSize":14247745,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-06-24T01:41:06.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=J2WFMRj9_VM","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/J2WFMRj9_VM\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"net.abern.exoplanets_1.1.21_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2398\/en\/images\/1\/S\/screenshot1.jpg","screenshot":"2398\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot1.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"2398\/en\/images\/2\/S\/screenshot2.jpg","screenshot":"2398\/en\/images\/2\/L\/screenshot2.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"2398\/en\/images\/3\/S\/screenshot3.jpg","screenshot":"2398\/en\/images\/3\/L\/screenshot3.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"2398\/en\/images\/4\/S\/screenshot4.jpg","screenshot":"2398\/en\/images\/4\/L\/screenshot4.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
