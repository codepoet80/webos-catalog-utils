{"publicApplicationId":"com.jbgapps.gentree","description":"*New update fixes Heredis file issues!*\nGot genealogy information?  GenTree is for you!  GenTree is a viewer for .ged (GEDCOM) files, a standard file format for genealogy information.  Most genealogy software & websites can export a .ged file.  Just load your .ged file on your phone with the USB cable and GenTree can read it and display your information.  Now you can carry your genealogy information with you wherever you go!\n\nSpecial characters not showing up? Try the preference setting for ANSI. That should do it for most!\n\nGenTree has been tested with file sizes up to 3MB, approximately 5800 individuals.  But it should also work with even larger file sizes. One customer reports using it with a file with over 32,000 individuals!\n\nIf you run into any issues, please use the Help page to send us an email (or send one directly to support@jbgapps.com) so we can make GenTree work for you!","version":"0.2.7","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.jbgapps.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/forums.precentral.net\/webos-apps-software\/279071-genealogy-app-webos-private-alpha-beta-test.html","custsupportemail":"support@jbgapps.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 JBG Apps","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":231360,"installSize":1605632,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-11-08T00:05:24.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.jbgapps.gentree_0.2.7_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"8369\/0.2.7\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_gentree_2011-06-04_213609.png","thumbnail":"8369\/0.2.7\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_gentree_2011-06-04_213609.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"8369\/0.2.7\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_gentree_2011-06-04_213621.png","thumbnail":"8369\/0.2.7\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_gentree_2011-06-04_213621.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"8369\/0.2.7\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_gentree_2011-06-04_213654.png","thumbnail":"8369\/0.2.7\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_gentree_2011-06-04_213654.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"8369\/0.2.7\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_gentree_2011-06-04_213714.png","thumbnail":"8369\/0.2.7\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_gentree_2011-06-04_213714.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"8369\/0.2.7\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_gentree_2011-06-04_213831.png","thumbnail":"8369\/0.2.7\/en\/images\/5\/S\/ph_gentree_2011-06-04_213831.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
