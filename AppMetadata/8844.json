The story of their downfall is related in a relentlessly hysterical style \u2013 possibly more easily enjoyed when read aloud! (Summary by Martin Geeson)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
