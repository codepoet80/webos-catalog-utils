We all have an inner sense of rhythm and quite frankly some have it and some simply do not. It is true that not everyone is meant to dance competitively and some will never refine their skills enough to make their way out of the mosh pit. However, there are those who have that inner sense of balance and rhythm. With proper instruction and the right inspiration these people have the potential to become phenomenal dancers. Read this book to get all the information about different types of dances and dance facts to help you get moving!","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","custsupportemail":"support@appbookshop.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 App Book Shop","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":303452,"installSize":3964928,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T08:34:28.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":3.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.appbookshop.epub.yourdancereferencehandbook_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"5413\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/yourdancereferencehandbook_2010-22-09_103443.png","thumbnail":"5413\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/yourdancereferencehandbook_2010-22-09_103443.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"5413\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/yourdancereferencehandbook_2010-22-09_103449.png","thumbnail":"5413\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/yourdancereferencehandbook_2010-22-09_103449.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"5413\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/yourdancereferencehandbook_2010-22-09_103455.png","thumbnail":"5413\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/yourdancereferencehandbook_2010-22-09_103455.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
