{"publicApplicationId":"com.mikagika.phil","description":"Need to hear wise words, sound advice, or something to enlighten you?  Me too.  But don't count on Phil for that.  Phil the Philosopher means well, and tries hard, but what he says may be nonsense.  Or it may be brilliant.  We all have good days.\n\n***New in this edition: Over one hundred additional sentences.  Hundreds of additional words.***\n\nFill in words for him to use, or let his years of collective wisdom & knowledge produce a thought for you to ponder all day.  Or maybe 3 seconds. How much can you expect from a talking bug?\n\nPhil's studies have encouraged him to shun negative thoughts, so you will not find negative or off-color words in his kid-safe vocabulary.  If you tell him to use such words he will, but don't blame him for the resulting sentences.  Phil suggests you take responsibility for your own actions.  Phil will not judge you for using misspelled or \"colorful\" words.  He wants only to share his wisdom to improve your life's journey.","version":"1.3.00","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/fillinphilosopher\/index.html","custsupportemail":"help@mikagika.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 mikagika, ltd.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":87500,"installSize":1572864,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-02-02T07:50:17.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mikagika.phil_1.3.00_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2827\/en\/images\/1\/S\/phil_shot1.png","screenshot":"2827\/en\/images\/1\/L\/phil_shot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"2827\/en\/images\/2\/S\/phil_shot2.png","screenshot":"2827\/en\/images\/2\/L\/phil_shot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"2827\/en\/images\/3\/S\/phil_shot3.png","screenshot":"2827\/en\/images\/3\/L\/phil_shot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"2827\/en\/images\/4\/S\/phil_shot4.png","screenshot":"2827\/en\/images\/4\/L\/phil_shot4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"2827\/en\/images\/5\/S\/phil_shot5.png","screenshot":"2827\/en\/images\/5\/L\/phil_shot5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
