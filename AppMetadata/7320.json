She initiated a revival of the English sonnet, helped establish the conventions of Gothic fiction, and wrote political novels of sensibility.\n\n    It was in 1784, in debtor\u2019s prison with her husband Benjamin, that she wrote and published her first work, Elegiac Sonnets. The work achieved instant success, allowing Charlotte to pay for their release from prison. Smith\u2019s sonnets helped initiate a revival of the form and granted an aura of respectability to her later novels.\n\n    Stuart Curran, the editor of Smith\u2019s poems, has written that Smith is \u201cthe first poet in England whom in retrospect we would call Romantic\u201d. She helped shape the \u201cpatterns of thought and conventions of style\u201d for the period. Romantic poet William Wordsworth was the most affected by her works. He said of Smith in the 1830s that she was \u201ca lady to whom English verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either acknowledged or remembered\u201d. By the second half of the nineteenth century, however, Smith was largely forgotten.
