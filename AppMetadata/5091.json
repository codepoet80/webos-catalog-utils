{"publicApplicationId":"com.blogspot.lingkuncheng.webospaigow","description":"Pai Gow, which uses domino tiles instead of poker cards, is the original casino game in which Pai Gow Poker was derived from. \n\nPai Gow is played by 2 to 8 participants, one of them play as the banker. Each participant is dealt 4 tiles, from a deck of 32 tiles. Each player has to decide on the strategy as of how to divide the 4 tiles into two hands of 2 tiles to create a high hand and a second-high hand. The two hands will then be compared with those of the banker's. The player wins the bet only if both hands have a higher value than those of the banker's. The player loses the bet if both hands have a lower value than those of the banker's. It is a push if the player wins one hand and loses the other hand. \n\nDecide on how to structure your high hand and your second-high hand to win the banker. Should you place stronger tiles in your second-high hand, at the expense of a weaker high hand? Or should you choose to give up on the second-high hand and just rely on a super strong high hand?\n\nIf you like Pai Gow Poker, you will also like Pai Gow - the original game.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/lingkuncheng.blogspot.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/lingkuncheng.blogspot.com","custsupportemail":"lyncolnc@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Lingkun Cheng","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":859410,"installSize":2293760,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T07:20:08.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.blogspot.lingkuncheng.webospaigow_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"5091\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/snapshot00.png","thumbnail":"5091\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/snapshot00.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"5091\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/snapshot03.png","thumbnail":"5091\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/snapshot03.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"5091\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/snapshot01.png","thumbnail":"5091\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/snapshot01.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"5091\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/snapshot04.png","thumbnail":"5091\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/snapshot04.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"5091\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/snapshot02.png","thumbnail":"5091\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/snapshot02.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
