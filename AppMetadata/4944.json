Presented in an intuitive interface, the app can be used in a study mode, where each question is paired with with a detailed explanation of the answer, or a test mode where users can simulate the exam experience.  ||  All of our app content is created exclusively for Upward Mobility by expert writers who have strong knowledge in the subject matter and all of our materials undergo a thorough review process.  This app was edited by Samantha Tanzer, Upward Mobility's Product Marketing Associate.  ||  About the CVPM:\n\"In 1989 the VHMA realized the increasing need among Veterinarians and Practice Managers for a program that would qualify the knowledge and experience necessary to successfully manage the ever-changing business management of today's veterinary practices. The Certified Veterinary Practice Manager (CVPM) certification is the result of that realization.\"  ||  Upward Mobility creates high quality management education and test preparation material that is witty, engaging, and adds value in the learning process.  *   We are a double bottom line company committed to education in the developing world. Some of the profits will be used to deploy education via mobile phone in emerging countries.","version":"1.0.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/upwardpro.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/upwardpro.com","custsupportemail":"info@upwardpro.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"DBL Partners LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":176156,"installSize":2064384,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T07:07:33.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":6.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.dblpartners.cvpm_1.0.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"4944\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1.png","thumbnail":"4944\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"4944\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/2.png","thumbnail":"4944\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"4944\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/3.png","thumbnail":"4944\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"4944\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/4\/L\/4.png","thumbnail":"4944\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/4\/L\/4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"4944\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/5\/L\/5.png","thumbnail":"4944\/1.0.3\/en\/images\/5\/L\/5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
