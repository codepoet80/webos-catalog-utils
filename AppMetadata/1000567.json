{"publicApplicationId":"com.iosif.hamlatzis.inversekinematics","description":"This is a demo that implements various inverse kinematics (IK) algorithms.\n\nKinematics is the process of calculating the position in space of the end of a linked structure, given the angles of all the joints. It is easy, and there is only one solution. \n\nInverse Kinematics does the reverse. Given the end point of the structure, what angles do the joints need to be in the achieve that end point. It can be difficult, and there are usually many or infinitely many solutions.\n\nThis process can be extremely useful in robotics. You may have a robotic arm which needs to grab an object. If the software knows where the object is in relation to the shoulder, it simply needs the calculate the angles of the joints to reach it.\n\nMulti-touch support. Use 4 fingers to move parts of the puppet.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"Extra characters of Puppet-Shadow Theatre are added.\n\nNow there are 14 characters to play with. Also you can turn on\/off the sound.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/16908666157704832683","supportURL":"http:\/\/7cecdab4.blogspot.com\/2012\/02\/inverse-kinematics.html","custsupportemail":"ahepa1976@yahoo.gr","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":4426818,"installSize":5931008,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-02-21T01:36:11.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=dUEfE2UPAY0","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/dUEfE2UPAY0\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.iosif.hamlatzis.inversekinematics_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.iosif.hamlatzis.inversekinematics\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_01_Screenshot.jpg","thumbnail":"com.iosif.hamlatzis.inversekinematics\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_01_Screenshot.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.iosif.hamlatzis.inversekinematics\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_02_Screenshot.jpg","thumbnail":"com.iosif.hamlatzis.inversekinematics\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_02_Screenshot.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.iosif.hamlatzis.inversekinematics\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_03_Screenshot.jpg","thumbnail":"com.iosif.hamlatzis.inversekinematics\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_03_Screenshot.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.iosif.hamlatzis.inversekinematics\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_04_Screenshot.jpg","thumbnail":"com.iosif.hamlatzis.inversekinematics\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_04_Screenshot.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
