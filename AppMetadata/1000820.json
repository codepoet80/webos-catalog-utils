{"publicApplicationId":"com.onecrayon.tapwatch.webos","description":"TapWatch is a simple and beautiful stopwatch for webOS that makes timing a joy.\n\nTap anywhere to start and stop, or double tap while a timer is running to start a new lap. Swipe to the left to view your 50 most recent times.\n\n* Keep your eye on what you are timing: your screen will stay awake as long as TapWatch is active and a timer is running.\n\n* Time comfortably: the whole screen is a button, so no hovering over small targets\n\n* Check progress with a glance: the timer is big, high contrast, and alone on the screen, allowing you to check the elapsed time or the time on your current lap with a glance. While running laps, the total time and your four previous laps are also tastefully displayed in smaller text.\n\n* Multitask: timers will continue timing in the background, even if you close the app.\n\n* Scales wonderfully: time anything, whether it lasts tenths of a second or hours.\n\n* Exhibition mode: use while docked on a touchstone\n\n* Optimized for all webOS devices: buy once and use it on your Pre, Pre2, Pre3, Pixi, Veer, or TouchPad (requires using the same webOS account on all devices)\n\nHELP & SUPPORT\n\nRidiculously good support is part of the package; if you feel anything is missing or not working properly please email support@onecrayon.com\n\nIf you enjoy TapWatch, try out TapNote, my deluxe Dropbox text editor for webOS.","version":"1.0.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/onecrayon.com\/tapwatch\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/onecrayon.com\/tapwatch\/","custsupportemail":"support@onecrayon.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 One Crayon","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":508054,"installSize":1474560,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T11:00:26.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":true,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.onecrayon.tapwatch.webos_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.onecrayon.tapwatch.webos\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_touchpad-001.png","thumbnail":"com.onecrayon.tapwatch.webos\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_touchpad-001.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.onecrayon.tapwatch.webos\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_touchpad-002.png","thumbnail":"com.onecrayon.tapwatch.webos\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_touchpad-002.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.onecrayon.tapwatch.webos\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_touchpad-003.png","thumbnail":"com.onecrayon.tapwatch.webos\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_touchpad-003.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.onecrayon.tapwatch.webos\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_2_touchpad-004.png","thumbnail":"com.onecrayon.tapwatch.webos\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_2_touchpad-004.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
