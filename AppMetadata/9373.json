{"publicApplicationId":"de.knoopnet.learntogo","description":"This app supports the learning of all kinds of 'word' to 'word' contents (e.g. vocabulary) offline.\nCorrect answers are shifted into an 'ok'-list, wrong ones will be asked again until learned. Tapping the question gives a hint to support learning.\nIf you use the 'save' option the app will load this 'learnlist.csv' at it's next launch & you may continue learning. The 'records'-option shows the results of the last 3 exercises which are cached for the next launch.\nYou may create your own list by editing the template. To delete a single pair just delete both entries and tap 'ok'. In the template or by choosing the 'Ok and edit next'-button, deleting is supported by default.\nYou may also use other lists: just copy them inside the 'LearnTgDB' folder as 'learnlist.csv'. The seperators in this .csv file are a ',' between the words and a '.' after each pair. The words themselves have to be put inside two \" -signs and the first pair of this .csv contains the titles.\nThis version of LearnToGo needs a minimum of 9 pairs to run and supports 50 pairs with a length up to 40 characters.\nMore features needed? Don't hesitate to send an email!\nFor further questions and remarks please also send an email to webmaster(at)knoopnet.de","version":"1.1.8","versionNote":"This small update prepares the app for the next webOs releases.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.knoopnet.de\/apps","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.knoopnet.de\/apps\/LtoG.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 knoopnet.de","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":13082,"installSize":327680,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-10-11T18:11:40.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"de.knoopnet.learntogo_1.1.8_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9373\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_Bild1a.png","thumbnail":"9373\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_Bild1a.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"9373\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_Bild2a.png","thumbnail":"9373\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_Bild2a.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"9373\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_Bild3a.png","thumbnail":"9373\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_Bild3a.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"9373\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_Bild5a.png","thumbnail":"9373\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_Bild5a.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"9373\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_Bild6a.png","thumbnail":"9373\/1.1.8\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_Bild6a.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
