{"publicApplicationId":"de.tomatoco.triples","description":"Modification of the well known finding pairs or memo game. In triples you have to find three cards with the same picture. Sounds quite easy but if the first two cards won't match your turn will already be over. So this might be quite challenging even if you're used to memo games. This game was inspired by the challenge of the weekly AppHack #6 \"Three\". Hope you like it!","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"minor fixes","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.tomatoco.de","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.tomatoco.de","custsupportemail":"triples@tomatoco.de","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 tomatoco","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":699262,"installSize":1703936,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-12-13T20:27:56.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"de.tomatoco.triples_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"de.tomatoco.triples\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_triples_2.png","thumbnail":"de.tomatoco.triples\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_triples_2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"de.tomatoco.triples\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_triples_1.png","thumbnail":"de.tomatoco.triples\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_triples_1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"de.tomatoco.triples\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_triples_3.png","thumbnail":"de.tomatoco.triples\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_triples_3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
