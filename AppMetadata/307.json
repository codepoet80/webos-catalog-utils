{"publicApplicationId":"com.brycelund.mosquitones","description":"Like to annoy teenagers without annoying yourself, friends, co-workers, or people you just don't like?\n Then Mosquitones is the app for you! Mosquitones has a Hearing Test & a Freeplay.  The Freeplay has 13 different high pitch sounds (frequently called \"mosquito tones\" or \"mosquito ringtones\") that can be used to annoy almost anyone.  The Hearing Test will guide you through a wizard and give you your results of how high you can hear.  These high pitch sounds are often used by teenagers as cell phone ringtones because teachers and other adults cannot hear them.\n\nTIP: To hear the higher tones best, without static, lower your volume to 2 below the full volume. Thanks to Michael G for the suggestion.\n\nNew in this Version:\nAdded Metrix Support","version":"1.0.8","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.brycelund.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/brycelund.com\/products\/mosquitones\/help.html","custsupportemail":"brycelundapps@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Bryce Lund","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2940308,"installSize":9830400,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T10:25:35.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.brycelund.mosquitones_1.0.8_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"307\/1.0.8\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_mos-screen1.jpg","thumbnail":"307\/1.0.8\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_mos-screen1.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"307\/1.0.8\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_mos-screen2.jpg","thumbnail":"307\/1.0.8\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_mos-screen2.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"307\/1.0.8\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_mos-screen3.jpg","thumbnail":"307\/1.0.8\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_mos-screen3.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
