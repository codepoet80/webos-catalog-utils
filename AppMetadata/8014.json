Perhaps based partly on Behn\u2019s own experiences living in Surinam, the novel tells the tragic story of a noble slave, Oroonoko, and his love Imoinda. The work was an instant success and was adapted for the stage in 1695 (and more recently by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1999).\n\n    Behn\u2019s work paved the way for women writers who came after her, as Virginia Woolf noted in a Room of One\u2019s Own (1928): \u201cAll women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn, \u2026 for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds.\u201d\n    (Summary by Elizabeth Klett)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
