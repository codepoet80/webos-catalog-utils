{"publicApplicationId":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx","description":"Update: Fixed occasional launch issues, added zipped rom support and other new features (please check out the full release log at KalemSoft website).\nNesEm is an award winning NES console system emulator. It recently won the Palm PDK Hot Apps award and won the best mobile game emulator awards by TechnoPalm and PDArcade in the past. You can play hundreds of NES games, also known as NES roms (not to be confused with SNES roms), with a single application. NesEm comes with two sample NES games. More games can be obtained separately and added to the application simply by placing them into the nesem folder on the Pre USB drive. Just connect your phone to your PC via USB cable and select USB drive mode on your phone when prompted. A new drive will appear on your computer. Open the drive by clicking its icon and create a folder named nesem (all lowercase) there. Then, copy your games with .nes or .zip file extension to the nesem folder directly. Finally, right click on the drive icon and select eject option to exit the USB drive mode and disconnect your phone from your PC. NesEm will see the games you added next time it is run (sometimes a device reset may be needed for the file system to recognize the files newly added). Note that if games are corrupt, NesEm may refuse to run them. You may use NesToy tool available at KalemSoft website to fix such games. \n\nNesEm has the following features. Support for various resolutions including full screen, on screen gamepad, GameGenie cheats, state saving with screenshots and configurable keyboard controls.\n** NesEm was developed from scratch. Many hours were spent on building and testing it over 7 years. It is not based on any Open Source work. We charge for NesEm just to recover part of the effort put towards building and maintaining it for different PALM devices over 7 years.  **","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.kalemsoft.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.kalemsoft.com\/support","custsupportemail":"support@kalemsoft.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2003-2011 KalemSoft","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":580178,"installSize":1835008,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-07-16T17:02:06.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/320x480_320x480_sc1.png","thumbnail":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/320x480_75x112_sc1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/320x480_320x480_sc2.png","thumbnail":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/320x480_75x112_sc2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/320x480_320x480_sc3.png","thumbnail":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/320x480_75x112_sc3.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/320x480_320x480_sc4.png","thumbnail":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/320x480_75x112_sc4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/320x480_320x480_sc5.png","thumbnail":"com.kalemsoft.nesemdx\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/320x480_75x112_sc5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
