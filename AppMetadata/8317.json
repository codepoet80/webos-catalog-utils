{"publicApplicationId":"com.mobile1up.caveman","description":"LETS GO! ... OH NO! (or.. YIPEE!)\n\nCaveman is a game where the goal is to guide Cavemen to the exit on the level. \n\n:: GAME PLAY\n\nCavemen enter the level through an open hatch and walk aimlessly to their death or around in circles following the path outlined - specific skills can be assigned to Cavemen to create a new path and help guide the others to the designated exit. \n\nThe following skill sets are available:\n\n- CLIMBER: scale those walls\n- FLOATER: float down to safety\n- EXPLODER: pop!\n- BLOCKER: block the path\n- BUILDER: build a bridge\n- BASHER: bash a horizontal path\n- MINER: mine a diagonal path\n- DIGGER: dig a vertical path\n\nEach level has a set of requirements to complete where a combination of skillsets may need to be used to solve the level - there is more than one solution available; how many cavemen can you save!\n\nWith four difficulty levels (easy, medium, obscure, insane) and 120 levels + hidden bonus levels - this game is guaranteed to bring you hours of enjoyment and gaming addiction! \n\n:: OPTIONS\n\nA number of game play options exist to customize the game play to individual preference; assignment of tools can be via clicking on the caveman, clicking on the toolbar or both. The game resumes play on touch by default but this can be disabled under the options screen.\n\n:: SOLUTIONS \n\nMobile 1UP has worked very hard to ensure that all levels are solvable; a complete set of solution guides for every level are available on the Mobile 1UP website (high definition video and detailed walk throughts) - of course the challenge is being able to solve them on your own! \n\n:: TIMEWARP\n\nA special \"unlock feature\" has been provided where unlocked levels can be accessed via a special code; in addition to revealing special secrets of the game engine (easter eggs) - a complete list of the relevant unlock codes are available on the Mobile 1UP website. Some codes change on a daily basis - so be sure to visit often to find all the goodies that are available!","version":"1.2.3","versionNote":"- version number to 1.2.3\n- do not show tools (on toolbar) that are not available in a level\n- implementation of \"classic\" particle explosion for retro goodness\n- bugfix: should not show tutorial overlay on non-tutorial levels (repeat)","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.mobile1up.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.mobile1up.com\/caveman","custsupportemail":"support@mobile1up.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011, Mobile 1UP","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":72619288,"installSize":97452032,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-12-10T22:07:20.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tM4FztVscWU","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/tM4FztVscWU\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"devPrivacyPolicyURL":"http:\/\/www.mobile1up.com\/privacy\/","noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":2.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mobile1up.caveman_1.2.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.mobile1up.caveman\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/480x320_480x320_ph_caveman-1.png","thumbnail":"com.mobile1up.caveman\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/1\/S\/480x320_75x112_ph_caveman-1.png","orientation":"L","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.mobile1up.caveman\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/480x320_480x320_ph_caveman-2.png","thumbnail":"com.mobile1up.caveman\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/2\/S\/480x320_75x112_ph_caveman-2.png","orientation":"L","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.mobile1up.caveman\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/480x320_480x320_ph_caveman-3.png","thumbnail":"com.mobile1up.caveman\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/3\/S\/480x320_75x112_ph_caveman-3.png","orientation":"L","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.mobile1up.caveman\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/4\/L\/480x320_480x320_ph_caveman-4.png","thumbnail":"com.mobile1up.caveman\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/4\/S\/480x320_75x112_ph_caveman-4.png","orientation":"L","device":"P"}}}
