When Mrs. Morel begins to be estranged from her husband because of his poor financial sense and his drinking habits, she comes to inhabit the lives of her children \u2013 most particularly, her sons. She is determined that they will grow to be something more than men that come home blackened with coal dust every day and roaring with drink every night. As each grows up and moves away, she must release him. But Paul, she holds; they have a bond that defies time and the attractions of young women.\n\n    Lawrence originally intended the book\u2019s title to be \u201cPaul Morel\u201d and it is on this son \u2013 and his lovers \u2013 that he spends the bulk of his tale. The strong mother can make a success of her son, but if he cannot learn to leave his mother\u2019s apron strings, will he really be a better man than his father? (Summary by Mark Smith) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
