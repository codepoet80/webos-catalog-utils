When he was captured behind enemy lines, the book was still a work in progress. The Armistice would not be reached until November of that year.\n\n    The sheer joy and wonder of man\u2019s early experience of leaving the bounds of Earth in an aircraft coupled with the danger and excitement of air combat made \u201cHigh Adventure\u201d such a good read, I completed the narration ahead of schedule, because I couldn\u2019t put it down.
