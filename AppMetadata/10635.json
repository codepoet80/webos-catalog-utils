{"publicApplicationId":"com.binarystorm.freetaptop","description":"This is the free version of TapTop, this version is limited to a game of 15 seconds and 3 different types of moles.\nIf you want to play during 30 seconds with 4 different moles (there is in the paid version a football mole that gives you 15 points but that you have to shoot twice), you can buy the paid version of TapTop for only $0,99.\n\n------\n\nLet\u2019s face it, nobody likes moles. That\u2019s why TapTop is so cool, you can shoot at moles as much as you want without having to stop! \n\nEnjoy 3 different types of moles: [-two different classical moles that give you 5 points each; -one blind mole that makes you lose 8 points; -a master-time mole that gives you 5 seconds of bonus time! (next updates should bring other awesome moles!)] and, if you\u2019re really crazy, try to beat our best score: 1142 points! \n\nGood game and Good luck ;-) \n\nFor more informations about our next games and projects, you can follow @tafle on Twitter ;)","version":"1.0.4","homeURL":"http:\/\/tristandot.free.fr\/binarystorm\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/tristandot.free.fr\/binarystorm\/","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Binary Storm","licenseURL":"http:\/\/tristandot.free.fr\/binarystorm\/","locale":null,"appSize":"6356964","installSize":"6356964","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":0,"currency":"USD","filename":"com.binarystorm.freetaptop_1.0.4_all.ipk","free":true,"images":[{"thumbnail":"10635\/icon\/S\/icon_1_0_4.png","screenshot":"10635\/icon\/S\/icon_1_0_4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
