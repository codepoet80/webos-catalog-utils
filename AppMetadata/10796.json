{"publicApplicationId":"com.aclassapps.soldiertalkplay","description":"*$2.00 off in honor of July 4th!* Soldier Talk Play Edition can actually Talk! You can now play back the original text you type or the translated text through the speakers or the headphone jack on your HP TouchPad. This app was developed in a week as a result of the webOS Weekly Hackathon contest from the HP webOS team.\n\nSoldier Talk Play Edition is an app that translates whatever text you enter into phonetic alphabets used by the military. Throughout history, these alphabets have changed and with Soldier Talk you can go back in time. Current alphabets available are; \n\n- ICAO Alphabet (NATO) \n- Royal Navy 1914 - 1918 \n- Signalese 1914 - 1918 \n- Royal Air Force 1924 - 1942 \n- Royal Air Force 1943 - 1956 \n- United States 1941 - 1956. \n\nOnce your text is translated, you have the options to share the results via email, text message, or even put your translated text into your Facebook status for your friends to see. \n\nWe believe that Soldier Talk Play Edition is not only for former and current military personnel, we believe that there are several other uses for Soldier Talk Play Edition. \n\nYou can use Soldier Talk Play Edition to send a coded message via text message or email. If you have a difficult name to spell or pronounce, you can use Soldier Talk Play Edition to help others spell and say your name correctly for once. Example: Ice is India Charlie Echo in the current ICAO (NATO) alphabet. \n\nWe are sure there are several other uses for Soldier Talk Play Edition. Please send us an email and let us know how you use Soldier Talk Play Edition.
