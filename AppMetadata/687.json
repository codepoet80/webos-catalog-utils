{"publicApplicationId":"com.fmb.njtransit","description":"Need to know when the next commuter train departs? Now you can put just exactly the information you need in your pocket or purse. After all, that's why you bought your Pre.  CommuterComputer features:  - Can use the Pre's GPS unit to figure out whether you are going to work, or if you are coming back, and shows your the right schedule.  - Set alarms on departure and\/or arrival time.  - Automatically updates the schedule once a minute, and shows you only the information you need.  Is it 5PM? Then why show you the trains leaving at 3PM or 4PM? As time moves on, departed trains drop off the schedule with no action on your part. The remaining time left to get to the station is updated as well.  - Currently CommuterComputer supports New Jersey Transit System, BART, and the LIRR with more transit systems in the works.  Tell us which one you want.  We'll do our best to include it.","version":"1.2.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.silverbillit.com\/CommuterComputer.html","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.silverbillit.com\/CommuterComputer.html","custsupportemail":"support@silverbillit.com","custsupportphonenum":"973.457.1011","copyright":"Copyright 2010 The Software Foundry, Inc.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":23160,"installSize":1987352,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-02-18T13:24:26.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.fmb.njtransit_1.2.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"687\/en\/images\/1\/S\/njtransit_2010-15-02_074110.png","screenshot":"687\/en\/images\/1\/L\/njtransit_2010-15-02_074110.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"687\/en\/images\/2\/S\/njtransit_2010-15-02_074126.png","screenshot":"687\/en\/images\/2\/L\/njtransit_2010-15-02_074126.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"687\/en\/images\/3\/S\/njtransit_2010-15-02_074248.png","screenshot":"687\/en\/images\/3\/L\/njtransit_2010-15-02_074248.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
