{"publicApplicationId":"com.webos-interactive.missingsearch","description":"webOS does a wonderful job of adding search engines that comply with the OpenSearch protocol to your device. The problem is, that not every website search engine complies with the OpenSearch Protocol. Even the ones that do, sometimes provide an icon that looks like it was scaled up from a 8-bit logo! \n\nSo what is a Bing lover to do, in order to get Bing as your search engine default on TouchPad? Well, you could write your own XML file that conforms to the Open Search protocol, or you could simply purchase this application and have us do all the hard work for you! \n\nNow, add Bing, Google+SSL, Xbox, Fox News, and Billboard to your TouchPad's Just Type feature! Not, only that, but we create search engine icons that look like the default search icons on your TouchPad. No scaled up messy 8-bit graphics logos here! Plus, if you want to use Bing as your default search engine, you can also use the SUGGEST feature, to grab suggestions straight from Bing. If we don't have your favorite website or search engine, please simply send us a request to edward@webos-interactive.com and we'll gladly add it for you!","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/webos-interactive.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/webos-interactive.com","custsupportemail":"edward@webos-interactive.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 webOS-interactive","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":59390,"installSize":491520,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T01:54:05.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.webos-interactive.missingsearch_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"10145\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_screen-01.png","thumbnail":"10145\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_screen-01.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"10145\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_screen-02.png","thumbnail":"10145\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_screen-02.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"10145\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_screen-03.png","thumbnail":"10145\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_screen-03.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"10145\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_screen-04.png","thumbnail":"10145\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_screen-04.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
