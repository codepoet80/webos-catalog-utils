{"publicApplicationId":"com.thebestformychild.standard","description":"Snapperfish Limited presents The Best For My Child (TM). Available in English only. \n\n\u2022 A simple, but powerful, decision support tool based on well-known child psychology. The tool explains, in easily understood language, why babies and children act the way they do and the best way to respond to them. \n\n\u2022 Over five years of intensive research into child psychology has been gathered for its development. The ideas presented are intended to strengthen the parent-child relationship, reduce child distress and anxiety, and promote good child self-esteem. Although none of the psychological concepts or interpretations is new, they do differ significantly from popular parenting beliefs and advice, and highlight how much unnecessary trauma many parents unwittingly inflict on their children.\n\n\u2022 Therefore, this tool is intended to expose parents to new ways of thinking about parenting, in the hope that they can choose better ways of relating to their children. It is especially appropriate for parents during the first few months and years of their child's life, but also applies to children of all ages. \n\n\u2022 The tool features: \u2714 guides (psychological concepts, mantras to follow, patterns to observe, rules to keep, and trouble-shooting) \u2714 guide ratings and explanations for difficulty to believe and difficulty to carry out \u2714 personalized guides with your child's name and gender so you can read about your own family \u2714 multiple reminders for Food Time, Bath Time, and Bed Time, all with a Soon function, help you to keep a consistent daily routine which is very important for young children and a consistent Food + Bath + Bed routine promotes easier bed time patterns in toddlers \u2714 Thought For The Day to keep the ideas fresh in your mind \u2714 context-sensitive help included within the application.\n\n\u2022 The Best For My Child is the mobile application for parents who truly want The Best for their child.
