{"publicApplicationId":"com.avnerarbel.peggermeister","description":"Pegger Meister is an addictive game perfect for anyone with a little time to burn while waiting for a meeting, a dental appointment, at the bus stop or subway terminal or at work when the boss is away.  The object of the game is to move the peg over an adjacent peg in order to remove it.  In order to jump over a peg, the hole on the other side must be vacant.  If you do it right and learn all the tricks with experience, you can win when only one peg is left on the board.  The way to win is to first get rid of all the pegs in the corners.  By leaving most of the pegs clumped together in the center until the end, you will probably have a greater chance of winning.  The lower the score is at the end, the better.  Low scorers are recorded in the records list.  There are several levels of difficulty which can be chosen from the preferences menu.    For those of you who are interested in history, the game was most probably invented in France in the late 17th century.    Now start playing the game before the boss returns!
