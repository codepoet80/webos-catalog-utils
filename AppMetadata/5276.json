{"publicApplicationId":"com.epik.wormp3","description":"**Please note, there appears to be a problem with how this plays on certain phones or with certain mp3 files. It has successfully been tested on a Sprint Pre with standard mp3 encoded songs. If that describes you, and you are still having issues please let me know. I really want to fix the errors. **\n\nFor people having issues with the gui, everything is done by swiping; you can't just push a button, you have to swipe in that direction. \n\nWormp3 is a variable speed mp3 player.  Pick an mp3 file and play it up to 4 times faster (no pitch correction so everything will sound like chipmunks) or slow it down to a quarter speed and make it last forever.
