{"publicApplicationId":"com.dumbstart.hoppergame","description":"Hopper, the number obsessed frog, is trying to clear his pond of lily pads. Hopper can remove the lily pads by jumping from one to the next, but is only able to hop a number of spaces equal to the number on his current pad. Go for the high score and avoid lily pads that have no moves, because it's game over if Hopper gets stuck. \n\nLuckily, Hopper has a super power! Once Hopper has cleared 50% of the lily pads, his power is activated! Once he gets stuck, he can hop to any pad on the board!\n\nHopper has multiple game modes; from the basic Hopper game play, to Hopper Stumps, Hard Mode, and a Puzzle mode. Each game mode has high scores and high clear percentages so you can challenge your personal best again and again! \n\nUnlock these alternate game modes by playing the game and earning awards. Earn enough awards and you can also unlock alternate graphics. Awards can be tough to earn but utilize the tips to figure out what it takes to unlock all 20!","version":"1.2.9","versionNote":"Hopper's Pond is on sale for .99!\n\nAlso, speed updates to the code.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.dumbstart.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.dumbstart.com\/pre\/hopper\/","custsupportemail":"mburks+Hopper@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Michael Burks","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":421502,"installSize":6291456,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T18:41:37.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.dumbstart.hoppergame_1.2.9_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"8132\/1.2.9\/en\/images\/1\/L\/hopper_2011-11-03_092445.png","thumbnail":"8132\/1.2.9\/en\/images\/1\/L\/hopper_2011-11-03_092445.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"8132\/1.2.9\/en\/images\/2\/L\/hopper_2011-11-03_092449.png","thumbnail":"8132\/1.2.9\/en\/images\/2\/L\/hopper_2011-11-03_092449.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"8132\/1.2.9\/en\/images\/3\/L\/hopper_2011-11-03_092558.png","thumbnail":"8132\/1.2.9\/en\/images\/3\/L\/hopper_2011-11-03_092558.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"8132\/1.2.9\/en\/images\/4\/L\/hopper_2011-18-02_162104.png","thumbnail":"8132\/1.2.9\/en\/images\/4\/L\/hopper_2011-18-02_162104.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"8132\/1.2.9\/en\/images\/5\/L\/hopper_2011-11-03_092618.png","thumbnail":"8132\/1.2.9\/en\/images\/5\/L\/hopper_2011-11-03_092618.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
