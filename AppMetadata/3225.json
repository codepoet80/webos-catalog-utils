{"publicApplicationId":"net.palmdoc.preopeval","description":"PreOp Eval organizes and presents much of the guidance that one needs in order to evaluate and prepare adult patients for non-cardiac surgery. It is based upon the guidelines on this topic from the American College of Cardiology & American Heart Association of 2007 and 2009, the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement of 2006, and the American College of Chest Physicians of 2008 (full references in the app). The app contains 1 algorithm and 3 resources: the cardiac evaluation algorithm, guidance on starting and stopping key medications in the perioperative period, guidance on timing of surgery after cardiac events, and guidance on preoperative testing.\nThe app addresses such common questions as:\n- who needs bloodwork before surgery?\n- who needs an EKG or a CXR?\n- how do I handle patients on Warfarin, Aspirin, and Clopidogrel?\n- which patients are recommended to get perioperative B-blockers or statins?\n- which active cardiac conditions preclude surgery?\n- how long after MI should a patient wait before surgery?\n- who needs bridging Heparin therapy, and which Heparin might I use?","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/palmdoc.net","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.cs.binghamton.edu\/~jsteinberg\/iphoneMedApps\/preOpEval\/index.html","custsupportemail":"jds.pocapps@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Dr. Alan Teh","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":73254,"installSize":12104295,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-05-06T20:20:31.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EWm3n3Zm7IA","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/EWm3n3Zm7IA\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"net.palmdoc.preopeval_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"3225\/en\/images\/1\/S\/preopeval_01.png","screenshot":"3225\/en\/images\/1\/L\/preopeval_01.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"3225\/en\/images\/2\/S\/preopeval_02.png","screenshot":"3225\/en\/images\/2\/L\/preopeval_02.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"3225\/en\/images\/3\/S\/preopeval_03.png","screenshot":"3225\/en\/images\/3\/L\/preopeval_03.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"3225\/en\/images\/4\/S\/preopeval_04.png","screenshot":"3225\/en\/images\/4\/L\/preopeval_04.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"thumbnail":"3225\/en\/images\/5\/S\/preopeval_05.png","screenshot":"3225\/en\/images\/5\/L\/preopeval_05.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
