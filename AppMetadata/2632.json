The email also contains the URL for Google Maps at your coordinates.  NiceGPSuperior is designed to be fully webOS compliant and will run on both the Pre and Pixi.  More updates are on the way!  Please share this with your friends who use webOS.  Version  1.3.0.  Map points now persist until you clear them, and a map can be saved.  Notification now pops up every time your location is found, and it gives a status on saved points for email and for the map.","version":"1.3.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/tonymiller.is-a-geek.com\/developersnice\/index.htm","supportURL":"http:\/\/tonymiller.is-a-geek.com\/developersnice\/index.htm","custsupportemail":"DevelopersNice@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"copyright 2010 DevelopersNice","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":53006,"installSize":1548239,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-06-16T01:49:10.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.developersnice.nicegpsuperior1_1.3.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2632\/en\/images\/1\/S\/nicegpsuperior1-map.png","screenshot":"2632\/en\/images\/1\/L\/nicegpsuperior1-map.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"2632\/en\/images\/2\/S\/nicegpsuperior1_2010-03-05_112900.png","screenshot":"2632\/en\/images\/2\/L\/nicegpsuperior1_2010-03-05_112900.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"2632\/en\/images\/3\/S\/nicegpsuperior1_prefs.png","screenshot":"2632\/en\/images\/3\/L\/nicegpsuperior1_prefs.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
