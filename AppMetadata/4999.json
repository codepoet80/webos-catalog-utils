Thanks for all the positive feedback!]\n\nThe iPhone hit, is here in full and for free - 100 unique puzzles and 10's of hours of gameplay await you to tax your mental agility and lateral thinking. More fun than brain training with guaranteed satisfaction as you travel across four environments beautifully detailed in full 3D. \n\nThe aim of TileStorm is to solve a series of puzzles by sliding the movable tiles enabling 'Eggbot' the robot to make his way through each respective level to the exit. The first puzzles are very similar in appearance and strategy to traditional sliding puzzle games, but later players will encounter tiles with completely different properties, maps with multiple solutions, and levels requiring the re-use of certain tiles. Not all tiles can be moved and some can only be moved in certain directions - look for the visual clues to help you solve the puzzle. As you play through TileStorm you will find that TileStorm is much more than just a sliding tile game and strategies required in many other games will be needed to complete this game. TileStorm is guaranteed to present a challenge to anyone that plays it and will require real skill and mental dexterity to complete. \n\nv.1.0.1. fixes back gesture exiting, webOS notifications are now displayed in Landscape, memory reduction and performance optimisations (especially on Pixi) and other improvements. \n\nPlease note that your progress is deliberately not saved in easy mode.
