These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nThis is an introduction to Einstein\u2019s space-bending, time-stretching theory of Relativity, written by the master himself. Einstein\u2019s theories shocked the world with their counterintuitive results, including the dissolution of absolute time. In the words of Einstein: \u201cThe present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.\u201d The book is challenging at times but, when approached patiently, proves itself one of the most lucid explanations of Relativity to be found anywhere. [Due to transcription or optical character recognition errors in creating online texts, and because of less-than-clear fonts in some printed texts, the variables as read in some of the equations here are not as Einstein intended. For example, the numeral 'one' has frequently been printed and read as the letter 'I.' In addition, some equations do not translate well into the spoken word. If you require completely accurate renditions of Einstein's mathematical formulas, we suggest that you consult a published text.] \u2014 Portion of Summary written by Kelly Bescherer [and Laurie Anne Walden] \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
