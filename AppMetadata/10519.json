{"publicApplicationId":"com.handmark.noad","description":"As Oxford's flagship American dictionary, the New Oxford American Dictionary sets the standard of excellence for lexicography in this country. With more than 350,000 words, phrases, and senses, and hundreds of explanatory notes, this dictionary provides the most comprehensive and accurate coverage of American English available.\n\nThe dictionary draws on the two-billion-word Oxford English Corpus and the unrivaled citation files of the world-renowned Oxford English Dictionary to provide the most accurate and richly descriptive picture of American English ever offered in any dictionary. The Third Edition offers a thoroughly updated text, with revisions throughout and approximately 2,000 new words, phrases, and meanings. Many new words relate to fast-moving areas such as computing, technology, current affairs, and ecology, while others have recently entered the popular lexicon. Usage notes have been updated in light of the most recent Corpus evidence, and a completely new in-text feature on Word Trends charts usage for rapidly changing words and phrases such as carbon, mobile, or tweet.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the New Oxford American Dictionary is the way it reflects the living language. Unlike in more traditional dictionaries, where meanings are ordered chronologically according to the history of the language, each entry plainly shows the principal meaning or meanings of the word, organized by importance in today's English. \n\nFeatures\n+ Over 60,000 audio pronunciations for dictionary entries\n+ No wireless connection required (audio pronunciations require wireless connection)\n+ Offers the most comprehensive, up-to-date coverage of current English\n+ New \"Word Trends\" feature charts usage for rapidly changing words and phrases\n+ Powered by Oxford's extensive language research program, including the 2-billion-word Oxford English Corpus\n+ New \"Word Trends\" feature charts usage for rapidly changing words and phrases","version":"1.0.1","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.handmark.com\/support","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.handmark.com\/support","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Handmark, Inc 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.handmark.com\/support","locale":null,"appSize":"199256688","installSize":"199256688","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"29.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.handmark.noad_1.0.1_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_tb_Accept.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_tb_Accept.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_tb_Accept.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_tb_Accept.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_tb_Accept.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/conv_tb_Accept.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_tb_Family.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_tb_Family.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_tb_Family.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_tb_Family.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_tb_Family.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/conv_tb_Family.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_tb_Future.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_tb_Future.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_tb_Future.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_tb_Future.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_tb_Future.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/conv_tb_Future.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/conv_tb_generation.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/conv_tb_generation.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/conv_tb_generation.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/conv_tb_generation.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/conv_tb_generation.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/conv_tb_generation.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/conv_tb_Quality.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/conv_tb_Quality.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/conv_tb_Quality.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/conv_tb_Quality.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/conv_tb_Quality.png","screenshot":"com.handmark.noad\/1.0.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/conv_tb_Quality.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
