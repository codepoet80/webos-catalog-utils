{"publicApplicationId":"com.prezysoftware.exch-calc","description":"Exch-Calc is a currency exchange calculator that provides any-to-any conversion of over 145 different currencies for a total of over 20,000 conversion possibilities.  And with our exclusive CATCH Technology, Exch-Calc not only automatically updates rates, it actually hunts out new currencies.  In addition to the 'bank' rate, you will see the rates that you will probably get when you use a credit card and money exchange counters, like at the airport.  Each time you start Exch-Calc it will access the internet and load up the latest exchange rates and seek out new currencies for you.  Then Exch-Calc stores those rates so that you do not need an active connection to perform your conversions.  If you're traveling where there isn't a signal, no problem, your stored rates will automatically be used to provide your calculation.  And you'll know how old those rates are because the latest date for each conversion rate is shown.  Perfect for when traveling where service is not available.","version":"1.0.3","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.PrezySoftware.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.PrezySoftware.com","custsupportemail":"PrezySoftware@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009\/2010\/2011 Prezy Software","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":26196,"installSize":720896,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-02-25T02:34:30.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":29.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.prezysoftware.exch-calc_1.0.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"450\/en\/images\/1\/S\/exchcalc_2009-17-11_191651.png","screenshot":"450\/en\/images\/1\/L\/exchcalc_2009-17-11_191651.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"450\/en\/images\/2\/S\/exchcalc_2009-17-11_191730.png","screenshot":"450\/en\/images\/2\/L\/exchcalc_2009-17-11_191730.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
