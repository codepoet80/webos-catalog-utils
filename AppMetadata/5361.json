{"publicApplicationId":"com.web-dojo.sounddojo","description":"***Note for existing users: If you have upgraded to a Pre 2 or other WebOS 2.0 device you must upgrade to version 1.0.5 or later!***\nSound Dojo is a simple player app for the SoundCloud music platform. It allows you to play any public Sound Cloud track on your phone whenever you have an Internet connection so you should find it useful for keeping up with your friends' and colleagues' music. Anyone can search for artists and play their tracks. If you are a SoundCloud member you can also see the users you follow and those that follow you. Sound Dojo version 1 simply plays tracks. Future versions will enable you to upload new tracks, follow new artists, make comments and so on.\nIn response to Andy M's review (who clearly has more fans than I do!) I've made artist lists filterable, but Sound Cloud doesn't publish detailed account statistics via the API, so it's not possible to display them in Sound Dojo.","version":"1.0.5","versionNote":"Fixed a bug that prevented Sound Dojo working with WebOS 2.0 or later.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.web-dojo.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.web-dojo.com\/?q=contact","custsupportemail":"sounddojo@web-dojo.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Web Dojo Ltd.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":37126,"installSize":1867776,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-05-27T05:43:34.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.web-dojo.sounddojo_1.0.5_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"5361\/en\/images\/1\/S\/HomeScene.png","screenshot":"5361\/en\/images\/1\/L\/HomeScene.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"5361\/en\/images\/2\/S\/FollowList.png","screenshot":"5361\/en\/images\/2\/L\/FollowList.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"5361\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ArtistScene.png","screenshot":"5361\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ArtistScene.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"thumbnail":"5361\/en\/images\/4\/S\/NowPlayingScene.png","screenshot":"5361\/en\/images\/4\/L\/NowPlayingScene.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
