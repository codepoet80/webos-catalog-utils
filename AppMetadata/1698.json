{"publicApplicationId":"com.jlp-tech.toddlertimeout","description":"This update allows you to change the length of the timeout. This simple timer program allows you to set an alarm when you need to put your child in timeout. The alarm sound can be set using the built in phone sounds, not very loud, or using ringtones for alarms. Each time an alarm goes off, the date of the alarm and the number of times per day is recorded under the childs edit screen.  Using an alarm keep you from forgetting how long each child has been in timeout and lets the  child know when \"timeout\" is over. Most experts agree that Children can fairly quickly begin to use their imagination to turn a boring activity into an interesting one.","version":"1.2.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.java-linux.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.java-linux.com","custsupportemail":"bounds@java-linux.com","custsupportphonenum":"540.446.3739","copyright":"Copyright 2010 JLP Tech.Com","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":60198,"installSize":2596377,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-03-21T10:09:43.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.jlp-tech.toddlertimeout_1.2.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"1698\/en\/images\/1\/S\/toddlertimeout_2010-30-01_190628.png","screenshot":"1698\/en\/images\/1\/L\/toddlertimeout_2010-30-01_190628.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"1698\/en\/images\/2\/S\/toddlertimeout_2010-10-03_214432.png","screenshot":"1698\/en\/images\/2\/L\/toddlertimeout_2010-10-03_214432.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
