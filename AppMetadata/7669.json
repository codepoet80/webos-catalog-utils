Suited to speed addicts - instead of solving puzzles, you just need to keep the board clear as new furballs are continually added!\n\nOTHER KEY FEATURES:\n* HINTS and UNDOs are provided to help you solve the puzzles when stuck\n* Original game music\n* Local & Global high-scores lists\n* Automatic saving of games - always come back to the game right where you left it!\n\n**************************************\n\n\"genuinely addictive ... replay value is incredibly high ... a polished, simple and engaging puzzler\" - ztgamedomain.com, 8.5\/10\n\n\"simple enough for a child to pick up and play, yet challenging enough to keep adults hitting the Undo button and trying again\" - appsmile.com, 5\/5\n\n\"slickly presented, fiendishly addictive and hugely popular puzzler\" - gamepeople.co.uk","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.candycaneapps.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.candycaneapps.com\/support\/","custsupportemail":"candycaneapps@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009-2011 Bevin Software OU","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":20205938,"installSize":27295744,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T16:15:03.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HfteaRTGyVw","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/HfteaRTGyVw\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.mbgames.fling_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"7669\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/fling-ss-1.jpg","thumbnail":"7669\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/fling-ss-1.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"7669\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/fling-ss-2.jpg","thumbnail":"7669\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/fling-ss-2.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"7669\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/fling-ss-3.jpg","thumbnail":"7669\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/fling-ss-3.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"7669\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/fling-ss-4.jpg","thumbnail":"7669\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/fling-ss-4.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"7669\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/fling-ss-5.jpg","thumbnail":"7669\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/fling-ss-5.jpg","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
