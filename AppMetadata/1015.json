{"publicApplicationId":"com.chickenfarm.litecamerafun","description":"Turn a boring photo into a fun and wacky laugh riot. Take a picture and transform it by adding funny items such as wacky hats, beards, glasses, and many more. You can take a new picture directly from Camera Fun! or open and edit an existing picture in your photo album. At this moment, saving photos is done by taking a screenshot. This the number one priority for future updates and we are working hard to implement this natively. Many new features will be added through free updates.  The Lite version has all of the features of the full version, but you are limited to the first (2) items in each funny bucket.  Download the full version to remove the ads and get all of the funny items.  Enjoy the app and have a beautiful day :)\nUPDATES:\n\n#1. Controls and menus no longer display when saving image via screen shot.  Click the \"save\" button or \"Hide\/Show Controls\" from the app menu.\n#2. Added precision controls to allow for extremely accurate movement of items.  This allows you to adjust your funny hats, beards, etc. to get them exactly where you want them.\n#3. New sweet animations added when showing or hiding the precision controls.\n#4. New cool animations added to the items selected.\n#5. New icons for scale, rotate, and the new move\/adjust tool.\n#6. New polaroid frame.  When saving the photo your picture is framed in a cool polaroid style frame.\n#7. You can also save without the polaroid frame by clicking on the \"Hide\/Show Controls\" under the app menu.\n#8. Improved support for landscape photos.
