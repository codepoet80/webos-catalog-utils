{"publicApplicationId":"com.izino.mvitepro","description":"m-Vite - Mobile Invitations allow you to quickly organize, manage events and send invitations, all from your Palm Pre. Use m-Vite to create invitations to events such as Parties, Dinners, Meetings, Activities, or any other events. You can also use the built-in themes to quickly design your invitation. Conveniently select guests from your Palm Pre Contacts to receive the invitations. Invitations are sent via SMS (text messaging) or e-mail , so any Palm Pre contact with an email address or mobile phone number can be added. Guests will be able to respond to the  invitation by marking their response as Yes, No, or Maybe. Once your guests respond to the invitation, you will immediately be able to view their response from the m-Vite application. m-Vite will group your guests responses in easy to manage lists. You can make changes to your invitation at any time, including adding and deleting guests. You can also re-send your invitation to all guests.  Events created in m-Vite are automatically added to your Palm Pre Calendar.\n***********UPDATE:_1.0.4********** Enabled 'Add Guest' phone number labels (Work, Cell, Home)","version":"1.0.4","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/izino.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/izino.com\/m-vite","custsupportemail":"izinoapps@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"..","copyright":"Copyright 2010 iZino.com","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":122648,"installSize":12055452,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T01:42:10.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.izino.mvitepro_1.0.4_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"2059\/1.0.4\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1_mvite_manage.png","thumbnail":"2059\/1.0.4\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1_mvite_manage.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"2059\/1.0.4\/en\/images\/2\/L\/2_mvite_expand_response.png","thumbnail":"2059\/1.0.4\/en\/images\/2\/L\/2_mvite_expand_response.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"2059\/1.0.4\/en\/images\/3\/L\/3_mvite_preview.png","thumbnail":"2059\/1.0.4\/en\/images\/3\/L\/3_mvite_preview.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"2059\/1.0.4\/en\/images\/4\/L\/4_mvite_invite.png","thumbnail":"2059\/1.0.4\/en\/images\/4\/L\/4_mvite_invite.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"2059\/1.0.4\/en\/images\/5\/L\/5_mvite_locations.png","thumbnail":"2059\/1.0.4\/en\/images\/5\/L\/5_mvite_locations.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
