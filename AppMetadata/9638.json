Dr. Joe &#8211; as he is affectionately known to millions of readers, listeners, viewers, and students &#8211; brings his magic formula to Doubleday Canada with  Brain Fuel .  As with Dr. Joe&#8217;s previous best-selling books,  Brain Fuel  informs and entertains on a wild assortment of science-based topics. But this is not &quot;science trivia.&quot; If you are looking for serious scientific discussions, you&#8217;ll find them here. If you are looking for practical consumer information, that&#8217;s here too. If you are searching for ways to stimulate interest in science, look no further, Mom. And if you are simply wondering why the birth of Prince Leopold was so different from Queen Victoria's previous seven; or why an iron rod that went through a man's head is now on display in a museum in Boston; or why white chocolate has such a short shelf life; or why eggs terrified Alfred Hitchcock &#8211; and what all of this means for the rest of us, and why &#8211; then bingo.
