{"publicApplicationId":"com.appbookshop.epub.foundandlostthefutureofsearch","description":"First, search is really quite awful. It is terrible it in many, many ways. People take for granted just how bad it is and this is based on their experience with search. It\u2019s not that good - most people don\u2019t realize this. It is really quite nasty. I want to wake people up. I want to wake you up and I want to get you talking about search and really all the ways that it could be possibly improved and all the ways it actually works pretty well. Second, there\u2019s very little deep thinking about search. I\u2019m talking about search from different perspectives like psychology, sociology, anthropology, philosophy and the like. I\u2019m not going to turn this into a graduate level lecture but I am going to take your mind in directions that it hasn\u2019t gone before on the topic of search. Learn all about search in this easy to use Found and Lost, the Future of Search ebook.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","custsupportemail":"support@appbookshop.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright AppBookShop 2010","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":273430,"installSize":5531429,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T04:45:50.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":3.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.appbookshop.epub.foundandlostthefutureofsearch_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"4155\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/foundandlostthefutureofsearch_2010-15-07_061232.png","thumbnail":"4155\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/foundandlostthefutureofsearch_2010-15-07_061232.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"4155\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/foundandlostthefutureofsearch_2010-15-07_061236.png","thumbnail":"4155\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/foundandlostthefutureofsearch_2010-15-07_061236.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"4155\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/foundandlostthefutureofsearch_2010-15-07_061242.png","thumbnail":"4155\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/foundandlostthefutureofsearch_2010-15-07_061242.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
