{"publicApplicationId":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus","description":"Remember the toy you had when you were a kid that let you sketch out crude drawings by turning the two knobs?  We designed roll-a-doodle with that experience in mind, but updated it for your webOS device.  Tilt your phone to roll a ball around the screen, drawing as it goes.  You can change the width, opacity, and color of the line.  As an added bonus you can even draw with a completely transparent line, which certainly takes care of that problem of how to get from one side of the drawing to the other!  Your doodles are saved, so you can continue working on your masterpiece later.   To erase, simply shake your device or turn it over.   \nIf you want to try before you buy, look for the base version of roll-a-doodle which is ad-supported, can only save two doodles, and doesn\u2019t allow you to change the background or hide the ball.\nFeedback via the reviews or email is always appreciated!\n+++++++++ Updated to add undo capability, bigger balls, and a few new colors!","version":"1.1.00","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/rolladoodle\/index.html","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/rolladoodle\/index.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2009 mikagika, ltd.","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.mikagika.com\/rolladoodle\/index.html","locale":null,"appSize":"43928","installSize":"43928","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"0.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus_1.1.00_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus\/1.1.00\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_rolladoodleplus_2010-07-02_170530.png","screenshot":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus\/1.1.00\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_rolladoodleplus_2010-07-02_170530.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus\/1.1.00\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_rolladoodleplus_2010-07-02_164247.png","screenshot":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus\/1.1.00\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_rolladoodleplus_2010-07-02_164247.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus\/1.1.00\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_rolladoodleplus_2010-07-02_164229.png","screenshot":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus\/1.1.00\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_rolladoodleplus_2010-07-02_164229.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus\/1.1.00\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_rolladoodleplus_2009-24-12_125608.png","screenshot":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus\/1.1.00\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_rolladoodleplus_2009-24-12_125608.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus\/1.1.00\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_rolladoodleplus_2009-24-12_125655.png","screenshot":"com.mikagika.rolladoodleplus\/1.1.00\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_rolladoodleplus_2009-24-12_125655.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
