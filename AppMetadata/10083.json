{"publicApplicationId":"com.calql8timezones","description":"Calql8 Time Zones is a world clock that lets you see the current and future time. Using a timeline display makes it easier to see how the time in one location relates to the time in another location. Rather than just show you the date and time, Calql8 Time Zones shows you the time and the time of other time zones with a slider so you can quickly identify which time zones are ahead and which time zones are behind your time zone. The slider is color coded to indicate the start of a new day as well as day and night. This allows you to more easily determine when you can set meetings, phone calls, and travel arrangements across time zones. Calql8 Time Zones lets you move time forward or backwards with a simple swipe on the touchscreen or the keyboard. Calql8 Time Zones does not require a data connection and works perfectly in Airplane mode. The list of time zones can be filtered by City, Country, or time zone offset so you can quickly identify the time zone you want to see. Watch the video to see how this all works.\n\n\nFeatures \n\u202212\/24 hour mode\n\u2022show\/hide seconds\n\u2022customize the time zone name\n\u2022 reorder able time zones\n\u2022daylight savings indicator for each time zone\n\u2022keyboard shortcuts for all actions\n\u2022animated startup screen\n\u2022works great on smaller Pixi and Veer screen sizes\n\u2022adjustable interval for time forecasting... 1 hour, 15 minutes, or 1 minute lets you adjust time to the minute\n\u2022Go To Date dialog allows you to jump directly to a date to.
