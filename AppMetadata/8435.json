It's optimized for the small Veer\/Pixi resolution (but runs an all webOS phones) and has lots of additional functions that make calculations easier & faster. It has the same features as '3lineProCalculator':\nThe multiline editfield is designed to 'tap' in the calculation according to the usual algebraic notation. Simply tap the [=]-button to get the result.\nThe formula may be saved as a shortcut & is cached in the 'history'. There is direct access to these shortcuts via the 'Sto\/Rcl'-button. The result is also stored and could be transfered into the editfield or one of 6 memory-entries for further calculations.\n4veerCalc provides several features via the app-menu:\n- Edit... - Enables the import and export of formulas or numbers via a display-tap.\n- Shortscuts\/f(x)... - Sets the functions reachable to [Const.\/f(x)] (scientific mode), [Num.Conv] (numeric conversions), [usef.Conv] (useful conversions) or [user defnd.] (user defined).

This set may be changed to [Num.Conv] (numeric conversions), [usef.Conv] (useful Conversions) or [user defnd.] (user defined) by the menu-option 'shortcuts'.\n[Sto\/Rcl] (Store\/Recall) Saves the number displayed in one of 6 memory entries \/ Puts the desired entry into the editfield.\n[up\/dn] Moves one step back or 'forward' in the editfield-history.\n[(,),^..] gives access to often used math. operators '(', ')', '^' etc.","version":"1.1.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.knoopnet.de\/apps\/index.html","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.knoopnet.de\/apps\/4veerC.html","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 by knoopnet.de","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":60236,"installSize":851968,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T19:41:28.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"de.knoopnet.4veercalc_1.1.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"8435\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/4veercalc_2011-10-04_200453.png","thumbnail":"8435\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/4veercalc_2011-10-04_200453.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"8435\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/4veercalc_2011-10-04_200525.png","thumbnail":"8435\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/4veercalc_2011-10-04_200525.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"8435\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/4veercalc_2011-10-04_200458.png","thumbnail":"8435\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/4veercalc_2011-10-04_200458.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"8435\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/4veercalc_2011-10-04_200634.png","thumbnail":"8435\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/4veercalc_2011-10-04_200634.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"8435\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/4veercalc_2011-10-04_201014.png","thumbnail":"8435\/1.1.2\/en\/images\/5\/L\/4veercalc_2011-10-04_201014.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
