This time he's determined to leave no gravestone unturned as he tries to prove that the ex-con and aspiring academic is mad, bad, and dangerous to know. Meanwhile, Edgar Wield rides to the rescue of a child in danger, only to find he has a rent-boy with a priceless secret under his wing. DC Bowler is looking forward to a blissful New Year with the girl of his dreams. Unfortunately, her dreams are filled with a horror too terrible to tell . . .And over all this activity broods the huge form of DS Andy Dalziel. As trouble builds, the Fat Man discovers (as have many deities before him) that omniscience can be more trouble than it's worth and that sometimes all omnipotence means is that you can have any colour you want, as long as it's black.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"8575546","installSize":"8575546","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"11.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.deathsjestbook-9780385672603-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9676\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9676\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9676\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9676\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9676\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9676\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
