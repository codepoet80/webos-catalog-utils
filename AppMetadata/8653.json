He was a journalist, a poet and a novelist. He wrote 80 books and 200 short stories in addition to his other work. He is perhaps best remembered for his \u2018Father Brown\u2019 stories; two collections of which are available at Librivox.org.\n\u2018The Man Who Knew Too Much\u2019 has some similarities to the Father Brown stories: Horne Fisher the eponymous hero is connected and indeed related to many of the high-ranking politicians of his age and thus \u2018knows too much\u2019 about the background of the mysteries in which he becomes embroiled and which he unravels. (Summary by Martin Clifton)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
