{"publicApplicationId":"com.googlecode.oplop","description":"This version of Oplop comes with the ability to save nicknames and a considerable user interface change. The old UI can still be accessed in the preferences. A first use help page has also been added.\n\nOplop makes it easy to create unique passwords for every account you have. Oplop only requires of you to remember a nickname & a master password to create a very safe & secure password just for you.\n\nYou get to choose the nicknames you use for each of your accounts so they act as a mnemonic, letting you make sure they are memorable. That means you can have safe & secure passwords for all of your accounts simply by remembering one master password & easy-to-remember nicknames for each of your accounts you use Oplop with. Oplop also makes sure there is at least one digit & one letter in every unique account password. The only thing that you need to keep secret is your master password.\n\nThe nicknames for each of account passwords can be written down if you like, since they are not useful without the master password.","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"Update for pre3 compatibility","homeURL":"http:\/\/oplop.googlecode.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/oplop.googlecode.com\/","custsupportemail":"bemajaniman@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010, 2011 Bem Jones-Bey, Brett Cannon","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":13990,"installSize":1212416,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-08-09T00:45:42.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.googlecode.oplop_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"3369\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_test_2011-26-05_222244.png","thumbnail":"3369\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_test_2011-26-05_222244.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"3369\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_test_2011-26-05_222337.png","thumbnail":"3369\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_test_2011-26-05_222337.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"3369\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_test_2011-26-05_222348.png","thumbnail":"3369\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_test_2011-26-05_222348.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"3369\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_test_2011-26-05_222405.png","thumbnail":"3369\/1.0.2\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_test_2011-26-05_222405.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
