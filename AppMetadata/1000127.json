{"publicApplicationId":"com.fuzzygizmo.annoyingnoises","description":"Annoying Noises is the must have app if you are trying to get on someones nerves. It comes with 20 really annoying noises that will drive almost anyone crazy. In addition to the annoying sounds, this app also has a different quote about annoying things on each page! It includes the famous mosquito tone!\n\nThis app will work on any webOS device. Buy it once and put it on all of your devices.\n\nThis app is not full screen for the touchpad because it does not look good when it is. I have tested it and it looks better in the emulator window.\n\nPlease leave a review!!!\n\n\n****The app might stop working after 4 sounds. This is not the app itself - it is your phone. Just close the app and reopen it and it should be fine. I do not know why this happens on some devices and not others. I think it has something to do with the OS version of the phone.****\n\nNew in version 1.5.1 - \n - Now fullscreen on the TouchPad\n - Remade about page\n\nNew in version 1.5.0:\n- New main menu background and title and footer change\n- 10 new annoying sounds\n- Made all of the sounds repeat so they don't stop until you tap stop\n- Reformatted all sound pages\n- Added a \"Leave A Review!\" button on the about page that sends you to the app in the app catalog\n- Made the website URL a link in the about page.\n- Locked the screen rotation to landscape\n- Updated icon","version":"1.5.1","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/fuzzygizmoapps.weebly.com\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/fuzzygizmoapps.weebly.com\/","custsupportemail":"fuzzygizmoapps@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 Fuzzy Gizmo","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2959786,"installSize":7733248,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T08:03:06.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.fuzzygizmo.annoyingnoises_1.5.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.fuzzygizmo.annoyingnoises\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_annoyingnoises_2012-08-01_223132.png","thumbnail":"com.fuzzygizmo.annoyingnoises\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_annoyingnoises_2012-08-01_223132.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.fuzzygizmo.annoyingnoises\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_annoyingnoises_2012-08-01_223138.png","thumbnail":"com.fuzzygizmo.annoyingnoises\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_annoyingnoises_2012-08-01_223138.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.fuzzygizmo.annoyingnoises\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_annoyingnoises_2012-08-01_223142.png","thumbnail":"com.fuzzygizmo.annoyingnoises\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_annoyingnoises_2012-08-01_223142.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},"4":{"thumbnail":"com.fuzzygizmo.annoyingnoises\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_annoyingnoises_2012-08-01_223156.png","screenshot":"com.fuzzygizmo.annoyingnoises\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_annoyingnoises_2012-08-01_223156.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}}}
