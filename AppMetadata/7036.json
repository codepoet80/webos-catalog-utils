{"publicApplicationId":"com.glbasic.drshiver","description":"\"Doctor, come quickly. The malinger from room No.3 just died!\" \n\"Well, now he's exaggerating.\" \n\nDiscover the day in a surgeon life! \n\nDr. Shiver is a skill game where you have to operate silly parts from a hapless patient using tweezers. If you're too sloppy, you don't earn money. \n\nIt can be played by 4 players at once and is especially suited for kids to train their fine motor skills. \n\nAn excellent waste of time when you're waiting for the meal in a restaurant with impatient (no pun intended) kids.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.glbasic.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.glbasic.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010-2011 Dream Design Entertainment","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":2476958,"installSize":6750208,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T13:36:28.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KjKTMK1wFQ0","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/KjKTMK1wFQ0\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.glbasic.drshiver_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"7036\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/DrBibber1.png","thumbnail":"7036\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/DrBibber1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"7036\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/DrBibber2.png","thumbnail":"7036\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/DrBibber2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"7036\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/DrBibber4.png","thumbnail":"7036\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/DrBibber4.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"7036\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/DrBibber5.png","thumbnail":"7036\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/DrBibber5.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
