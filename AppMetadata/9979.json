{"publicApplicationId":"com.supergigamega.weatherdashhd","description":"Weather Dashboard is a webOS dashboard application that displays the current temperature and conditions as well as the forecast for the next day on your HP Touchpad.\n\nWeather Dashboard works like a widget for your webOS device and always runs in the background so you can quickly see the weather. Tap on the dashboard to toggle through displays of Current Conditions, Today's Forecast, and Tomorrow's Forecast. Tap on the weather icon in the dashboard display to be taken to Yahoo! Weather page for the location.\n\nIf your webOS device is setup to enable notifications when the screen is locked, you can see the current weather conditions when your device is on a touchstone charger or by just turning your device on without unlocking the screen.\n\nNew in version 1.0.5:  Added day, date, and time to exhibition display, bug fixes, visual updates to exhibition mode display.","version":"1.0.5","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.supergigamega.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.supergigamega.com\/weatherdashboardhd\/","custsupportemail":"support@supergigamega.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2011 SuperGigaMega LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":4744282,"installSize":7929856,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T02:02:30.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":true,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.supergigamega.weatherdashhd_1.0.5_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"9979\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_weatherdashhd_1.png","thumbnail":"9979\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_weatherdashhd_1.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"9979\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_weatherdashhd_2.png","thumbnail":"9979\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_weatherdashhd_2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"9979\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_weatherdashhd_3.png","thumbnail":"9979\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_weatherdashhd_3.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"9979\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_weatherdashhd_4-2.png","thumbnail":"9979\/1.0.5\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_weatherdashhd_4-2.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
