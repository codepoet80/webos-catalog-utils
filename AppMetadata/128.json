{"publicApplicationId":"com.hobbyistsoftware.vlcremote","description":"VLC Remote does _not_ work with VLC 2.00\n\nUnfortunately given that Web OS seems to be dying - it doesn't make sense for us to update our Web OS apps.\n\nYou can continue to use VLC Remote with older versions of VLC if you choose.\n\nWe do hope that HP will find a compelling story for Web OS and we'll be encouraged back, but that isn't looking likely at the moment.\n\n----\n\nControl VLC on your PC or Mac directly from your Pre or Pixi Plus (this app requires Wifi connection). Play, Pause, set Volume and Position. Toggle fullscreen mode and skip tracks. Add items to you playlist, or remove them. Simple setup - Run the VLC Helper on your computer. It will configure VLC to allow access. Compatible with Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7, Mac OS 10.5+. This update improves connection reliability, and manages battery usage more efficiently. If you have any problems using it, please email me. My email address is in the application.\n\nThis update adds the ability to save multiple remotes, and use the keyboard for subtle volume and position control.","version":"1.1.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.HobbyistSoftware.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.HobbyistSoftware.com","custsupportemail":"support@hobbyistsoftware.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Hobbyist Software","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":267290,"installSize":9730885,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T01:57:10.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yEYaXV5aRDw","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/yEYaXV5aRDw\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.hobbyistsoftware.vlcremote_1.1.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"128\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/ph_Main-Screen.png","thumbnail":"128\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_Main-Screen.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"128\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/ph_DVD.png","thumbnail":"128\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_DVD.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"128\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/ph_Browse-Hard-Drive.png","thumbnail":"128\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_Browse-Hard-Drive.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"128\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/ph_DVD.png","thumbnail":"128\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_DVD.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"128\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_Advanced.png","thumbnail":"128\/1.1.0\/en\/images\/5\/S\/ph_Advanced.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
