Logging can be active for a single project or multiple projects. \n\nOptionally log notes as you start or stop a project. Product pie charts and reports by week, day, and month or for a date range. Report on a complete project. Set a cost per Project\/sub-project and these can display on the reports. \n\nEmail reports or upload to Google docs. Backup to Google docs.\n\nThis is the same as the full version except you can only have a total of 2 categories and 5 projects, and you can backup to Google docs but not restore. New Features: Add new option to Preferences 'List Mode'. 'List Mode' is the standard mode in TimeKeeper, when not on, you will be presented with 'Card mode'. 'Card Mode' gives you two drop downs for the Category and Project and an Active\/Stopped selector. It also shows at the bottom a handy list of today's activities. Preferences can only access now when no Project is active.\n\n1.3.9\nNew Features:\n* Added Preference for default number of days for Date Range Report.\n* Added Preference for starting weekly reports on a Sunday not Monday.\n* Added Preference number of days between a backup reminder being shown at application start-up.\n* Added Report option to either show 'All Projects' or 'Selected Projects', this automatically toggle All Categories to be 'Yes' if All Projects is 'No', and visa versa.","version":"1.4.1","versionNote":"1.4.1\nBug Fixes:\n  Less Logging.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.blurapps.co.uk","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.blurapps.co.uk","custsupportemail":"timekeeperlite@pkbedford.co.uk","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 P.K.Bedford","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":795566,"installSize":5898240,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-11-08T21:06:59.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"uk.co.pkbedford.timekeeperlite_1.4.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"uk.co.pkbedford.timekeeperlite\/1.4.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_TimeKeeper1XL.PNG","thumbnail":"uk.co.pkbedford.timekeeperlite\/1.4.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_TimeKeeper1XL.PNG","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"uk.co.pkbedford.timekeeperlite\/1.4.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_timekeeper2xl.png","thumbnail":"uk.co.pkbedford.timekeeperlite\/1.4.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_timekeeper2xl.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"uk.co.pkbedford.timekeeperlite\/1.4.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_timekeeper3xl.png","thumbnail":"uk.co.pkbedford.timekeeperlite\/1.4.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_timekeeper3xl.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"uk.co.pkbedford.timekeeperlite\/1.4.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_timekeeper4xl.png","thumbnail":"uk.co.pkbedford.timekeeperlite\/1.4.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_timekeeper4xl.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"uk.co.pkbedford.timekeeperlite\/1.4.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/1024x768_1024x768_tb_timekeeper5xl.png","thumbnail":"uk.co.pkbedford.timekeeperlite\/1.4.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/1024x768_480x320_tb_timekeeper5xl.png","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
