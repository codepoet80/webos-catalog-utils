These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nA supernatural fantasy about the mystical adventures of a lonely English boy named Jimbo\u2013who can fly! It\u2019s really quite beautiful and can be enjoyed by adults and teenagers alike. Be warned, however: The death of a beloved character and a creepy old house haunted by the wraith-like spirits of children makes some of this story far too scary for younger kids or indeed anyone of a sensitive disposition. Algernon Blackwood (1869-1951) was born in south London and wrote many tales of the supernatural.
