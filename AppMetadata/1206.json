{"publicApplicationId":"www.mobent.us.bennytheboulder","description":"Meet Benny The Boulder,  Benny The Boulder is a interactive pet rock for the Palm Pre. Benny is no ordinary rock though. You can play with Benny and he will respond. Benny has a wide range of emotions from Happy to Sad and everything in between.  Like most lifeforms Benny also needs his sleep and will rest when he's tired. You can wake Benny up of he's asleep but be careful, no one likes a cranky boulder. If Benny does get cranky you can stroke him to calm him down or poke him to make him angry, but be careful or you'll end up making Benny cry.","version":"1.0.2","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.mobent.us\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.mobent.us\/","custsupportemail":"support@mobent.us","custsupportphonenum":"800.440.5959","copyright":"Copyright 2010 MOBENT, LLC.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":1731488,"installSize":3669565,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-02-23T22:55:50.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":1,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"www.mobent.us.bennytheboulder_1.0.2_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"1206\/en\/images\/1\/S\/load.png","screenshot":"1206\/en\/images\/1\/L\/load.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"1206\/en\/images\/2\/S\/normal.png","screenshot":"1206\/en\/images\/2\/L\/normal.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"1206\/en\/images\/3\/S\/night.png","screenshot":"1206\/en\/images\/3\/L\/night.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
