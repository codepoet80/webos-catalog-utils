Eating gluten free and eating out is always a challenge. It's even harder when traveling to a foreign country. Getting a restaurant to prepare food for you that is gluten free is a real challenge. That's where this app comes in. The restaurant cards in this app explain to restaurant staff that you cannot eat food with gluten in 50 languages! Version 2 changes the interface to be easier to navigate. To find a particular restaurant just start typing and it will filter the list as you type!\n\nThese cards are provided by CeliacTravel.com free of charge.
