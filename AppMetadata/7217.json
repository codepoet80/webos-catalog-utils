{"publicApplicationId":"com.appible.themagiccityaudiotext","description":"This Plus version of The Magic City includes both audio and text so you can follow along or read without the audio.\n\nIn this app you can download & store chapters for listening without an internet connection, perhaps on your next flight or road trip. These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\n    Philip and Lucy discover that the city Philip has built using toys, books and household objects, has come alive. This is the account of their incredible adventures in those magical lands, where they meet characters from books and history, mythical beasts, and many other nice (and not so nice) people and creatures.\n\n    As with all Edith Nesbit\u2019s tales, The Magic City has generous helpings of humour, imagination and interesting ideas, as well as the over-arching story of how a boy and girl who have unwillingly become step-brother and sister eventually learn to like each other.\n\n    A story that works on many levels and will be equally enjoyed by adults and children. (Summary by Ruth Golding)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain. The app is based on drPodder which was graciously provided to the open source community by drnull.","version":"1.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","supportURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Appible LLC","licenseURL":"http:\/\/appible.com\/contact","locale":null,"appSize":"280740","installSize":"280740","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"1.8","currency":"USD","filename":"com.appible.themagiccityaudiotext_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"7217\/images\/1\/L\/themagiccity1.png","screenshot":"7217\/images\/1\/L\/themagiccity1.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},{"thumbnail":"7217\/images\/2\/L\/themagiccity2.png","screenshot":"7217\/images\/2\/L\/themagiccity2.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
