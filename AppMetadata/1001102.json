From tweets, toolbars, buttons, colors, font sizes, borders.. anything you see you can change! The level of customization allowed in Neo is UNMATCHED.\n\nChoose from preset themes (more coming), or build your own, save them, and then build some more. It doesn't matter how you do it, the point is you CAN!
