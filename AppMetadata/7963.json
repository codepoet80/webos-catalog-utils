These audiobooks are great for your commute, long trips, hours at the gym or to just listen while washing the dishes.\n\nPat Travis, a spacer renowned for his luck, is suddenly quite out of it. His job is to beat his competitors to sign newly-Contacted human races to commercial contracts...\n\nBut what can he do when he finds he's on a planet that consults astrology for literally every major decision - and he has arrived on one of the worst-aspected days in history?\n\nMichael Shaara, later to write the Pulitzer-winning novel \"The Killer Angels\", wrote this story for Fantastic Universe in 1956. (Summary by Mark F. Smith)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
