Move the dust mite around space by tilting the phone while avoiding collisions with the enemy (Palm cell phone competitors). Tap the enemy to kill them and move on to additional levels. Avoid all objects, some are enemies and can be killed, others are not. As you advance, the levels become more difficult to conquer. Higher levels become very intense.
