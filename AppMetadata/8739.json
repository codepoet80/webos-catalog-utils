It was written around 1513, but not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli\u2019s death. The treatise is not actually representative of his published work during his lifetime, but it is certainly the best remembered one.\n(Summary from Wikipedia.org)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
