In her revision of Ophelia from Hamlet, she creates a backstory for Shakespeare\u2019s tragic heroine, from her infancy to just before the action of Hamlet begins. (Summary by Elizabeth Klett) \n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
