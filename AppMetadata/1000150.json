{"publicApplicationId":"com.discipleskiessoftware.gpsexplorer","description":"GPS Explorer features location tracking, a robust waypoint management system, and other powerful navigation tools.  Get all common GPS parameters while navigating with a GPS controlled compass which features smooth degree-by-degree rotation.   Calculated parameters include distance traveled which is reported by an odometer linked to a satellite signal rate interpreter.  The signal rate interpreter is used to enhance the accuracy of odometer readings.  Save your current position as a waypoint or enter a set of known coordinates directly into the waypoint database.  Navigating to a waypoint is as simple as tapping on one of your saved waypoints and following the waypoint-finding compass, which will always point to your waypoint.  In waypoint navigation mode, get distance to waypoint, speed, heading and estimated time of arrival.  As you travel, trail mode is operating quietly under the scenes, storing your path.  Review your path at any time to help you retrace your footsteps.  An energy saving mode is included which is particularly useful when travelling long distances with relatively few turns.","version":"9.0.0","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011 Disciple Skies Software","licenseURL":"http:\/\/www.discipleskies.com","locale":null,"appSize":"2507816","installSize":"2507816","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"2.99","currency":"USD","filename":"com.discipleskiessoftware.gpsexplorer_9.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"1000150\/icon\/S\/icon_9_0_0.png","screenshot":"1000150\/icon\/S\/icon_9_0_0.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}]}
