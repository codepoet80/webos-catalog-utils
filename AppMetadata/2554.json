{"publicApplicationId":"de.reger-clan.track-my-work","description":"PALM HOT-APPS CONTEST WINNER!!!\n\nAvailable in: English, German.\nTrackMyWork is a time tracker for collecting your working hours especially for employees. You can check in & out per day as often as you want. The working time gets summarized per day and week. Entries can also be added, altered and deleted manually. \n\nDifferent categories (for example working time, free time, holidays, etc.) can also be assigned, as well as a short description per entry. Night shifts are supported. \n\nData can be imported, exported and cleared (also by date range). Working hours can be summarized by year, month, week and days and can be rendered graphically.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for this app please contact me by mail, before posting any non 5-stars review.\n\nNEW:\n1.0.30:\n- Exhibition mode is supported now","version":"1.0.30","versionNote":"Exhibition mode is supported now","homeURL":"http:\/\/klausreger.wordpress.com\/2011\/04\/20\/webos-software\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/klausreger.wordpress.com\/trackmywork\/","custsupportemail":"trackmywork@gmx.de","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009-2011 by Klaus Reger","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":176774,"installSize":4227072,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T05:51:40.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-VIadJsnNt8","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/-VIadJsnNt8 \/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":true,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":2.49,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"de.reger-clan.track-my-work_1.0.30_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"2554\/1.0.30\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_TP-01-Week.png","thumbnail":"2554\/1.0.30\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_TP-01-Week.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"2554\/1.0.30\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_TP-02-EditEntry.png","thumbnail":"2554\/1.0.30\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_TP-02-EditEntry.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"2554\/1.0.30\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_TP-03-Statistics.png","thumbnail":"2554\/1.0.30\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_TP-03-Statistics.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"2554\/1.0.30\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_TP-05-Grpahics.png","thumbnail":"2554\/1.0.30\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_TP-05-Grpahics.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"5":{"screenshot":"2554\/1.0.30\/en\/images\/5\/L\/ph_04-Preferences.png","thumbnail":"2554\/1.0.30\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_TP-06-ExhibitionMode.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
