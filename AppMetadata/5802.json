{"publicApplicationId":"com.appbookshop.epub.thenewyorkreferencemanual","description":"There are so many wonderful things to do and see in New York City. It's hard to imagine that in a lifetime someone could possibly manage to get to them all. The problem is that many of them sound like so much fun it's hard to choose between the men and select the few. The best solution for me is to stick with things that can't be done at home. Playing in parks for the most part can be done at home. This book will guide you through your vacation to New York and help you get the most from your holiday while giving you tips of what to do and see with out blowing your budget.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.appbookshop.com","custsupportemail":"support@appbookshop.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"2010 AppBookShop","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":359464,"installSize":4030464,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-01T09:48:33.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":3.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.appbookshop.epub.thenewyorkreferencemanual_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"5802\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/icon-320x480.png","thumbnail":"5802\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/1\/L\/icon-320x480.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"screenshot":"5802\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/thenewyorkreferencemanual_2010-15-10_234321.png","thumbnail":"5802\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/2\/L\/thenewyorkreferencemanual_2010-15-10_234321.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"screenshot":"5802\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/thenewyorkreferencemanual_2010-15-10_234327.png","thumbnail":"5802\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/3\/L\/thenewyorkreferencemanual_2010-15-10_234327.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"4":{"screenshot":"5802\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/thenewyorkreferencemanual_2010-15-10_234336.png","thumbnail":"5802\/1.0.0\/en\/images\/4\/L\/thenewyorkreferencemanual_2010-15-10_234336.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
