{"publicApplicationId":"com.fuzzindustries.d3","description":"Dominion Deck Designer or D3 is a practical utility for quickly developing your 10 card master deck for playing the popular card game, Dominion. This version includes all of the following sets:  Original Base set, Seaside, Prosperity, Alchemy, Intrigue, and Cornucopia. You have the option to filter any combination of  sets, on or off. You can also optionally remove attack cards, duration cards, victory cards or treasure cards from the randomization process. Once the deck is created, you can sort the resulting list by cost, name or set and name. When playing subsequent games, you can have the app retain a minimum number of cards from the previous set and the card list will highlight the cards that were from the previous draw.  You can also selectively delete\/replace a single card from your list.\n\nAll in all, I think you\u2019ll find this little app very handy when you and your friends sit down for a quick round of Dominion and you don\u2019t want to fuss with drawing your master set. Once you\u2019ve tried it, please send me feedback and comments so I can improve the app.","version":"1.2.3","versionNote":"In this version the application has been reformatted to support HP Touchpad.  Also, minor corrections to the card dictionary have been made.  Highlighting for previously used cards in the deck designer has been improved for readability.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.wedevelopsolutions.com\/fuzzind","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.wedevelopsolutions.com\/fuzzind","custsupportemail":"mgraphman@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2012 Fuzz Ind.","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":384778,"installSize":2686976,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T08:35:59.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":1.49,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.fuzzindustries.d3_1.2.3_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"com.fuzzindustries.d3\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_tp-cardoptions.jpg","thumbnail":"com.fuzzindustries.d3\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/1\/S\/tb_tp-cardoptions.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"com.fuzzindustries.d3\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_tp-deckdesigner.jpg","thumbnail":"com.fuzzindustries.d3\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/2\/S\/tb_tp-deckdesigner.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"com.fuzzindustries.d3\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_tp-deckdesigner2.jpg","thumbnail":"com.fuzzindustries.d3\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/3\/S\/tb_tp-deckdesigner2.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"com.fuzzindustries.d3\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_tp-cardoptions2.jpg","thumbnail":"com.fuzzindustries.d3\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/4\/S\/tb_tp-cardoptions2.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"com.fuzzindustries.d3\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_tp-mainmenu.jpg","thumbnail":"com.fuzzindustries.d3\/1.2.3\/en\/images\/5\/S\/tb_tp-mainmenu.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
