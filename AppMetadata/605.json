{"publicApplicationId":"com.invasivebamboo.t9cryptogram.lite","description":"The free limited Lite version of our popular T9 Cryptogram game! It has 15 famous quotes of various difficulty for you to try! Invasive Bamboo presents a new twist of the classic Cryptogram word puzzle, the T9 Cryptogram! Many of us have grown up using the T9 method of entering text in our mobile phones.  Using the number pad, you can select from among 3 or 4 letters for each number.  Someone who is proficient at this can think of the words they need using only these numbers.  We are putting you to the test! T9 Cryptogram uses the same number and letter combinations that you\u2019re so familiar with. Using these combinations we put up real quotes for you to decrypt. There are levels from easy to hard and more than 100 quotes from short to long, witty, funny, relevant and real for you to solve. This fast paced cryptogram game is not only fun but you also learn and retain these great quotes.  You will see the quote on the screen using these numbers only and you have to figure it out using the letters just as if you were texting. Based on your level, you can check that you entered the right quote letter per letter or when you\u2019re done with the entire quote. The quotes do not repeat and you can go through them in any order you want using simple WebOS gestures to flick through them. Invasive Bamboo plans on updating the quotes so even if you think you got them all? There will be more waiting for you.  Keep up to date on our website.
