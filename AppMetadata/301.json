It has eight built in layouts plus the ability to do custom layouts. \n\nThe program features hand-drawn graphics from Sinacism Graphics who did the graphics for Reversi.  \n\nYou clear the marbles off the board by jumping one marble over another\ninto an empty space. The marble you jump over is removed from the\nboard automatically.  Only one marble can move at a time, and only in an up, down, left or right direction. Never diagonally. The game is won when only one marble remains.
