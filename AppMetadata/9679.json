{"publicApplicationId":"com.scrollmotion.corduroymansions-9780307375254-rhca","description":"From the author of the global bestseller \"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\" comes a brand-new novel - the start of a new series - set in the heart of London. \"Corduroy Mansions\" is the affectionate nickname given to a genteelly crumbling mansion block in London's vibrant Pimlico. This is the home patch of - among others - a lovelorn literary agent, possibly the first ever nasty Liberal Democrat MP and Freddie de la Hay, an urbane terrier trained to be vegetarian and respectful of feline rights, and with the ability to fasten his own seatbelt. With his trademark wit, charm and lightness of touch, Alexander McCall Smith introduces a colourful cast of characters, full of the life, laughter and humanity so beloved in his writing.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"7479292","installSize":"7479292","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"24.95","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.corduroymansions-9780307375254-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9679\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9679\/en\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9679\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9679\/en\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9679\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9679\/en\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
