{"publicApplicationId":"net.pierrox.webos.mcompass","description":"A simple marine compass : move your phone in all positions, and the compass will always stay parallel to the floor ! Just for fun !\n\nPLEASE NOTE : this application uses the GPS for heading. You need to move to get a reliable direction, otherwise the compass will be inaccurate.\n\n*** if the compass keeps spinning, it means that there is no GPS location, only a network location or not location at all. The Pre\/Pixie tends to prefer network location over GPS location in cities or when wifi is enabled, because it is now accurate and consumes less energy, however only GPS location gives a direction. A GPS fix can take between a few seconds and several minutes with clear sky. This application works best if wifi is \"off\", because wifi \"on\" may prevent the GPS to start.","version":"1.0.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.pierrox.net\/","supportURL":"http:\/\/pierrox.net\/","custsupportemail":"pierrox@pierrox.net","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"copyright 2010 PierroX","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":74578,"installSize":327680,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":true,"lastModifiedTime":"2010-09-09T16:17:37.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"net.pierrox.webos.mcompass_1.0.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"5057\/en\/images\/1\/S\/screenshot.png","screenshot":"5057\/en\/images\/1\/L\/screenshot.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
