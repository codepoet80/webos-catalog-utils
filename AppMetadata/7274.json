This beautiful story of adventure and innocent love was H.D. Stacpoole\u2019s most popular work.\n\nParents who may have seen the Hollywood film need not be anxious about the book's suitability for kids -- the author's treatment of adolescent sexuality is almost mystical and very mild.

A ship\u2019s doctor, Henry De Vere Stacpoole (1863\u20131951) published over 90 works of fiction, poetry, autobiography, and translation.
