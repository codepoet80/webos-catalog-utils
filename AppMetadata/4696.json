{"publicApplicationId":"de.omoco.mishigame","description":"UPDATE: The game now starts a bit slower, small bugfixes. I NEED YOUR HELP TO IMPROVE THE CONTROLS! PLEASE MAIL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW TO IMPROVE THE CONTROLS OF THE GAME! --- Mishigame is a game inspired by Tetris. You need to fill up the lines by moving and rotating the pieces falling from the top. It gets faster by and by. You lose when you can not place a new piece. You control the game by tapping at the touchscreen. There is a Highscore to see your own results. This game is originally written by Marcel Sebek and has been ported by omoco to the webOS platform. This is an early version and my first attempt to port a game to webOS. It may contain some bugs.
