{"publicApplicationId":"com.shanerooni.quicksolve","description":"***UPDATE: Only a dropdown menu update per Palm's requirement.  The game will soon be updated so you only have to fill in the missing part of the equation to make it more \"rapid fire\".***  QuickSolve is a beat-the-timer math game.  You are given a 6 character equation, and you must type out the characters, filling in the blank to solve the equation, with the 25 (5x5) buttons below the timer.  The quicker you solve it, the more points you will get.  If you need help, you are able to tap the equation character(s), but you will not receive points for them.  You are able to change the options of which types of equations to include, what level to start on, and how fast the timer depletes.  Be smart, be careful...  be quick!","version":"0.8.6","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.shanerooni.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.shanerooni.com","custsupportemail":"admin@shanerooni.com","custsupportphonenum":"484.654.2668","copyright":"Copyright 2009 Shanerooni, LLC","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":172904,"installSize":831409,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2009-12-09T00:51:33.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.shanerooni.quicksolve_0.8.6_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"439\/en\/images\/1\/S\/quicksolve_2009-17-11_230111.png","screenshot":"439\/en\/images\/1\/L\/quicksolve_2009-17-11_230111.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"439\/en\/images\/2\/S\/quicksolve_2009-17-11_230044.png","screenshot":"439\/en\/images\/2\/L\/quicksolve_2009-17-11_230044.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"439\/en\/images\/3\/S\/quicksolve_2009-17-11_230056.png","screenshot":"439\/en\/images\/3\/L\/quicksolve_2009-17-11_230056.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
