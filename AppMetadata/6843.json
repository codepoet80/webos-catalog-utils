{"publicApplicationId":"com.jakyl.tilestormhd","description":"TileStorm is newly updated for Pre and Pixi and now even more beautiful presented in an HD version! 100 unique puzzles and tens of hours of gameplay await you to tax your mental agility and lateral thinking as you discover why this game was a hit on iPhone. More fun than brain training with guaranteed satisfaction as you travel across four environments beautifully detailed in full 3D. \n\nThe aim of TileStorm is to solve a series of puzzles enabling 'Eggbot' the robot to make his way through each respective level to the exit. The first puzzles are very similar in appearance and strategy to traditional sliding puzzle games, but later in TileStorm players will encounter tiles with completely different properties, maps with multiple solutions, and levels requiring the re-use of certain tiles. Not all tiles can be moved and some can only be moved in certain directions - look for the visual clues to help you solve the puzzle. As you play through TileStorm you will find that TileStorm is much more than just a sliding tile game and strategies required in many other games will be needed to complete this game. TileStorm is guaranteed to present a challenge to anyone that plays it and it will require real skill & mental dexterity to complete. \n\nPlease note that the HD version of the game is functionally identical to the non-HD version aside from improved graphics and performance - there are no new puzzles or other features. If you already have the non-HD version, then there is no need to upgrade unless you enjoy the game so much that you'd like the extra visual quality and performance or you'd like to support our work in which case we would be very appreciative.\n\nIf you have any problems with the game, please email us at support@massivehadron.com.\n\nEnjoy!","version":"1.5.1","versionNote":"* Workaround for save data being lost when TouchPad is restarted.","homeURL":"http:\/\/www.massivehadron.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/www.massivehadron.com","custsupportemail":"support@massivehadron.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2009-11 Andrew Cakebread","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":10420492,"installSize":44793856,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2012-06-02T03:07:45.000+0000","mediaLink":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6nV0WR9HtR8","mediaIcon":"http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/6nV0WR9HtR8\/2.jpg","attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":["null"],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":true}},"price":3.99,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"com.jakyl.tilestormhd_1.5.1_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":true,"images":{"1":{"screenshot":"6843\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/1\/L\/tb_screenshot1024x768_1.png","thumbnail":"6843\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/1\/S\/ph_screenshot480x320_1.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"2":{"screenshot":"6843\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/2\/L\/tb_screenshot1024x768_2.png","thumbnail":"6843\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/2\/S\/ph_screenshot480x320_2.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"3":{"screenshot":"6843\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/3\/L\/tb_screenshot1024x768_3.png","thumbnail":"6843\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/3\/S\/ph_screenshot480x320_3.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"4":{"screenshot":"6843\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/4\/L\/tb_screenshot1024x768_4.png","thumbnail":"6843\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/4\/S\/ph_screenshot480x320_4.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"},"5":{"screenshot":"6843\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/5\/L\/tb_screenshot1024x768_5.png","thumbnail":"6843\/1.5.1\/en\/images\/5\/S\/ph_screenshot480x320_5.jpg","orientation":"L","device":"T"}}}
