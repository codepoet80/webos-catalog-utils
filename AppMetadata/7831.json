His name is one of the most recognizable names in history and one of the most enduring of composers. At age 5, this \u201cwunderkinder\u201d took to the stage and began his life as a prolific and celebrated creator-genius of such luminous works the world has not known since. This collection of morsels taken from his personal letters is engaging and gives a look into the mind of the boy wonder. Was he mad? Was he miraculous?
