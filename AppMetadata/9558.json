{"publicApplicationId":"com.scrollmotion.creationanovel-9780307369314-rhca","description":"In mesmerizing prose, novelist Katherine Govier explores the fateful summer in the life of a man as untamed as his subjects. Running two steps ahead of the bailiff, alternately praised and reviled by critics, John James Audubon set himself the audacious task of drawing, from nature, every bird in North America. The result was his masterpiece, The Birds of America, which he and his family published and sold to subscribers on both sides of the Atlantic. In this atmospheric and enthralling novel, Katherine Govier recreates the summer in which the world's greatest living bird artist finally understood the paradox embedded in his art: that the act of creation was also an act of destruction.","version":"0.9.90","homeURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","supportURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","custsupportemail":"","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2011","licenseURL":"http:\/\/scrollmotion.com","locale":null,"appSize":"6853114","installSize":"6853114","isEncrypted":null,"adultRating":null,"islocationbased":null,"lastModifiedTime":null,"mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":[],"price":"13.37","currency":"USD","filename":"com.scrollmotion.creationanovel-9780307369314-rhca_0.9.90_all.ipk","free":false,"images":[{"thumbnail":"9558\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","screenshot":"9558\/images\/1\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot1.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9558\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","screenshot":"9558\/images\/2\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot2.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"},{"thumbnail":"9558\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","screenshot":"9558\/images\/3\/L\/conv_tb_screenshot3.png","orientation":"P","device":"T"}]}
