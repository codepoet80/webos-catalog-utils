What they find is a magic castle straight out of a fairy tale, complete with an enchanted princess at the center of a maze. Or is it? The castle turns out to be just a country estate, and the princess is only the housekeeper\u2019s niece, playing at dressing up. But the magic ring she shows them proves \u2014 to her surprise and horror \u2014 to really be magic. Soon they are caught in an adventure where statues come alive, lost lovers are reunited, and wishes can be granted \u2014 but always for a price. (Summary by Peter Eastman)\n\nThis audiobook uses recordings from Librivox.org, a community of generous volunteers who record public domain works and then publish their recordings in the public domain.
