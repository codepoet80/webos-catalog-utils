It is a simple search page with options to choose from several free online formularies (some may require registration and login but they are free). The advantage of Drugview is that it will allow one to quickly perform multiple searches from various formularies for the same drug.\nUpdate in v 0.5.0 : Improved webView with spinner and back button. Added MIMS Malaysia to the list.\nUpdate 0.6.0: Added back Epocrates to the search since they have officially announced they will not support webOS next year.","version":"0.6.0","versionNote":"","homeURL":"http:\/\/palmdoc.net","supportURL":"http:\/\/palmdoc.net\/?page_id=2618","custsupportemail":"palmdoc@gmail.com","custsupportphonenum":"","copyright":"Copyright 2010 Dr. Alan Teh","licenseURL":"","locale":"en_US","appSize":81348,"installSize":2228224,"isEncrypted":false,"adultRating":false,"islocationbased":false,"lastModifiedTime":"2011-05-05T11:28:32.000+0000","mediaLink":null,"mediaIcon":null,"attributes":{"provides":{"noApp":false,"dockMode":false,"universalSearch":false,"connectors":[],"services":[],"optimizedUserExperience":false}},"price":0,"currency":"USD","isAdvertized":false,"filename":"net.palmdoc.drugview_0.6.0_all.ipk","free":false,"touchpad_exclusive":false,"images":{"1":{"thumbnail":"2102\/en\/images\/1\/S\/drugview_2010-12-03_062452.png","screenshot":"2102\/en\/images\/1\/L\/drugview_2010-12-03_062452.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"2":{"thumbnail":"2102\/en\/images\/2\/S\/drugview_2010-21-11_203454.png","screenshot":"2102\/en\/images\/2\/L\/drugview_2010-21-11_203454.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"},"3":{"thumbnail":"2102\/en\/images\/3\/S\/drugview_2010-21-11_203529.png","screenshot":"2102\/en\/images\/3\/L\/drugview_2010-21-11_203529.png","orientation":"P","device":"P"}}}
