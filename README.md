**Deprecated**

The Museum's archive is now... archived, rendering these tools out of date.

New entries can be added to the museum by manually editing the [newerAppData.json](https://github.com/codepoet80/webos-catalog-backend/blob/main/newerAppData.json) file in a deployed instance of the back-end. Corresponding metadata should be added to the [AppMetadata](https://github.com/codepoet80/webos-catalog-metadata) location specified by the back-end's [config](https://github.com/codepoet80/webos-catalog-backend/blob/main/WebService/config-example.php) file. Packages and images must be self-hosted by the app publisher as they can no longer be added to the archive.

C# Based utilities for sorting, scraping and compiling webOS app catalog bits.
Requires seperate AppCatalog archive not included in this repo.
